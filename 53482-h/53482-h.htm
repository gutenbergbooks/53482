<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>War between Russia and Austria has been
inevitable since the latter first cast her eyes
eastwards and decided that Salonika was
to be the object of her expansion. To
reach a port on the east the Teuton must
crush the Slav. Fundamentally, it is a
battle of races. Hitherto the Teuton has
managed to avoid actual conflict; by means
of carefully designed coups at opportune
moments, or, to put it more bluntly, by
the methods of a common thief, he has
made very good progress during the last
few years without risking his own skin.
But on the present occasion circumstances
were not so favourable as they appeared
to be; and instead of catching Slavdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
at a disadvantage, he caught it ready to
fight for its existence&mdash;a serious miscalculation
which bids fair to have the most far-reaching
results.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Greeks, Turks
and the sparse Teutonic population, the
inhabitants of the whole of eastern and
south-eastern Europe are of Slavonic origin.
They number roughly 125 millions, and
they possess the best of all rights to their
territories&mdash;that of settlement at the time
when the Aryan peoples migrated from
Asia to Europe. The Russians, Rumanians,
Bulgars, Montenegrins and portions
of the Serbs, Croats and Poles are
either self-governing or under the rule of
other Slavonic peoples. The remaining
Slavs are under Teuton domination. In
East Prussia the Kaiser rules Poles, Kassubes
and Serbs, while Austria has several
millions of Polish, Czech, Ruthenian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Serbian, Croatian, Slovenik and Slovak
subjects.</p>

<p>The Slav is the world’s most fervent
nationalist. An intense and unconquerable
vitality is the outstanding characteristic
of every Slavonic people. Like the
Jews they maintain their national traits
distinct and unchanged in spite of centuries
of foreign domination. Their conquerors
have never been able to absorb them.
Unlike the Jews, however, this vitality
is not passive but active. They have never
been subdued. When not actively hostile
they are sullenly awaiting the opportunity
to throw off the yoke. For nearly five
hundred years Serbia was a Turkish province,
held in the most ruthless subjection.
But during all that time Serbia never forgot
that once she had been an empire, nor
faltered in her determination to be an
empire again. In 1817 the chance came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and Serbia rose like a nation defending its
liberties rather than a rebellious people with
a dozen generations of bondsmen for forebears.
The modern experiments of Germany
and Austria have not proved any
more successful than the mediæval methods
of the Turks. Neither country has had a
moment’s peace from its Slavonic subjects.
They have never dared play any part but
the bully’s.</p>

<p>The growth of the organised Pan-Slavist
movement has added enormously to their
difficulties, and Austria in particular has
had many anxious moments in the eastern
portions of her Mosaic empire. The movement
is the definite expression of Slav
aspirations. It aims at unity, if not actual
union, amongst all the Slav peoples.
Russia is the natural head of the movement,
and the ultimate aim is a collection of free
Slavonic nations under the suzerainty or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
protection of the Tzar. In the meantime
the immediate object is to free the Slavs
who are under the rule of foreign races.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to
Serbia’s aspirations to be once more the
empire she was in the days before the Turks
overran south-eastern Europe. When in
1817 she at length threw off the Turkish
yoke her object was but half fulfilled. A
further portion was won back as a result
of the recent Balkan War. But there still
remain some millions of Serbs under Hapsburg
rule. In 1908 Austria, taking advantage
of Russian weakness, seized the
provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, both
of which are peopled by Serbs. For a
time war seemed inevitable. But the
Powers stepped in and Serbia, unable
to rely on strong Russian help, was forced
to acquiesce. She had formally to renounce
all claims to be a more natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
ruler for Serbs than mongrel Austria, to
moderate the activities of the Pan-Slavist
societies all of which were more or less
bitterly opposed to Austria, and to profess
to be perfectly satisfied with the arrangement
and full of neighbourly love.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that such an
agreement, forced on a small nation by the
Great Powers, would prove anything but a
farce. Serbia very naturally resented the
indignities which she had suffered. The
nationalist societies, instead of being suppressed,
became more bitter and bolder in
their activities. The chief of them, the
Narodna Obrava, has an immense membership,
drawn from all classes. It is to be
found in every town and village. The
press, the army and the government service
are its most enthusiastic adherents.</p>

<p>One evening, early in June, five members
of the Narodna Obrava met in a house near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the royal palace at Belgrade and hatched the
plot which was destined to prove the spark
that kindled the European conflagration.
All the world knows how well their plans
were conceived, how faithfully carried into
execution. On June 28th the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian
throne was, with his wife, murdered in the
streets of Serajevo, the chief town in Bosnia.</p>

<p>There is no need here to dwell on subsequent
events. After a delay of some
three weeks, Austria was bullied by Germany
into presenting her famous Note
to Serbia. Every line of that Note was
a studied insult designed to make Russian
intervention and war inevitable. Serbia
was exhausted in every way after her two
wars with Turkey and Bulgaria, Russia
was in the midst of a scheme of military
reorganisation which still required a couple
of years for completion. War was the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
desire of either country. Acting on Russia’s
advice, Serbia made an almost abject reply
to Austria. But Germany was not to
be denied. She was determined to unsheath
the sword. Every proposal for
peace was dismissed for the most trivial
reasons, every precautionary measure was
exaggerated into a hostile act. At last,
on Friday, August 1st, when the German
military preparations were practically complete,
Baron von Pourtales, the German
Ambassador, called on M. Sazonov, the
Foreign Minister and formally demanded
that the Russian partial mobilisation should
cease within twelve hours. At seven o’clock
the following day war was declared and
Russia took up her task of defending Slavdom
from the Teuton menace, and incidentally
saved western Europe from its direst
peril since the days when Napoleon thought
to crush its liberties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The eastern campaign has been more or
less overshadowed by the western, especially
during the early days of the war. It was
natural that it should be so. The western
campaign was the more sensational. The
Kaiser hurled his finest forces westwards;
every day brought its vital news; doubts,
joys, fears crowded one on the other;
there were no tedious preliminaries, no
hesitation, but smashing stroke and counterstroke.
The storm in the east was comparatively
slow in gathering and it lacked
the spectacular element.</p>

<p>The result was that Russia was both
neglected and misunderstood. In spite of
the public welcome accorded to journalists
by the Grand Duke Nicholas, the official
lust for secrecy is as fierce in the east as
in the west. Only the sparsest details have
been allowed to be published. Defeats
have been ignored or dismissed as “local<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
checks.” Every victory has been acclaimed
a triumph and every step forward has been
supposed to echo menacingly in the streets
of Berlin and in the Kaiser’s headquarters.</p>

<p>It has been practically impossible to
obtain a clear view of the eastern campaign,
and consequently it is not to be wondered
at that there has sprung up a general
disposition to regard Russia as something
of a disappointment. Ignorance of the
conditions under which she is fighting
caused impossible triumphs to be expected
of her.</p>

<p>The best corrective for this distorted
vision is to study the eastern war from the
Russian point of view. It is that point of
view that I have endeavoured to set forth
in these pages. No claim is made to any
secret knowledge; in view of the extraordinary
strict censorship in Russia, such
a claim would be absurd. But it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
to record and explain the events as they are
known and understood by representative
opinion in Russia. Moreover, sufficient
of the earlier stages of the campaign have
emerged from the fog of war to enable
the period within these pages to be analysed
in the light of subsequent events. In the
circumstances, it can be confidently claimed
that the views generally held by men of
moderate opinion in Russia provide a
reliable if somewhat sketchy history of the
campaign. Some details may be meagre,
others faulty; that is only to be expected
when for descriptions of the actual fighting
it is necessary to rely to a very large extent
upon the stories of the wounded. But the
general outlines and deductions are undoubtedly
correct, and the study of them will
enable the man in the west to understand
and appreciate the many difficulties connected
with the war in the east.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Nation and the War</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The war that the nation fights is already
half won. Tzars, Kaisers, Kings and Governments
may spend millions on perfecting
their fighting machines, they may hurl
those machines at one another, but unless
they have behind them the united will of
their subjects, their efforts are bereft of more
than half their force. The victorious army
is the one which enjoys the whole-hearted
support of a people prepared to face any
sacrifice for the sake of its cause. The
moral factor is as important as the material
or the ethical. History is full of instances
of wars being won against heavy odds by
the sheer enthusiasm of a people determined
to win at all costs. For a modern example<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
it is only necessary to glance at the Austro-Serbian
campaign.</p>

<p>The Kaiser knew very well how essential
it is for a nation to present a united front to
the foe. Ever of a religious disposition,
he realised how true was the text that a
house divided against itself falls to the
ground. And so he chose his moment
carefully. Britain was on the verge of
civil war over the Irish crisis; France
was torn asunder with political passions;
both would obviously prove easy victims.
And Russia? Unfortunately for the Imperial
plans Russia was in a contented state.
But the defect could soon be remedied!
Russia has a reputation for strikes and
revolutions, two of the most valuable allies
an invading army can have. And so it
happened that July saw the renewal of
labour troubles in Petrograd, Moscow and
other large towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
The first sign that trouble was brewing
came from the famous Putilov works, the
Russian armament factory. For some time
past Germany has been evincing a very keen
interest in the factory, and not so long ago
an insolent attempt was made to get the
control of the works into the hands of
German Jew financiers. Of course the
attempt failed and Germany had to content
herself with filling the place with her
spies. There is little doubt that the German
Secret Service was primarily responsible
for the strikes of 1914. For no particular
reason beyond vague references to the
“rights of labour” and “the glorious
revolution,” some thousands of Putilov
workmen went on strike. Thanks to a
vigorous campaign throughout the country
by real and imitation labour agitators,
their example was extensively followed.
Workers in mills, factories and railways<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
answered the call. Hundreds of thousands
were on strike although there was still no
formulated demands on the part of their
leaders. The strikers were fed on the
stock phrases and generalities of the demagogue’s
programme. Soon rioting took
place. The military had to be called out,
and on several occasions at Petrograd
the Cossacks came into serious conflict
with the strikers.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the war clouds gathered.
Russia appeared to have been caught at
the most inopportune moment possible.
The war danger arose at the very time
when the strike movement seemed to be
at its height. There is no doubt that
Russia’s advice to Serbia in regard to the
latter’s reply to Austria’s Note was to a
large extent dictated by the unfortunate
internal condition of the country.</p>

<p>But the nation rose to the occasion in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
a manner which even Russia’s warmest
friend would hardly have dared to predict.
The national danger forged a united people.
The rioting and other disturbances ceased.
The military remained in their barracks;
there was no work for them in the streets.
Then, as the international situation grew
graver the strikers realised how insignificant,
yet how dangerous, were their own squabbles,
and they began to troop back to work of
their own accord. Throughout that period
of agonising suspense the Russian statesmen
received no more inspiring news than
this. It was the only ray of light that
pierced the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>The people, realising that war was inevitable
days before the Governments gave
up hope of peace, acclaimed it with enthusiasm.
Next to the Jews, the Germans,
or <i>Nemetz</i>, as they are called, are the most
hated foreigners in Russia. They are found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
in nearly every town and village, and their
national habit of growing prosperous at
the expense of their hosts has earned
for them an honest hatred. The average
Russian was only too pleased at the prospect
of getting a chance of paying off a few old
scores. In addition to personal dislike,
the racial aspect of the war was also a very
strong consideration with the Russian democracy.
Pan-Slavism is a very real doctrine
amongst the <i>mujhiks</i>, who have an unlimited
faith in the heaven-sent destinies of their
race. There is hardly a soldier in all Russia’s
immense army that does not regard the
freeing of all sorts and conditions of Slavs
as his most sacred duty.</p>

<p>And there was the religious question
to add to the nation’s enthusiasm. Russia
is the most religious nation in Europe.
Every home, no matter how humble, has
its ikon. The festivals of the Church are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
real holy days, and not mere secular
holidays. The Church itself is indeed the
mother of the people. The simple, unquestioning
faith of the <i>mujhiks</i> is without
a parallel in Europe, except perhaps in
the remote districts of Ireland. Religion
is a reality with them; it enters into every
action of their daily life. In the towns, of
course, much of this faith has been lost,
and there is a parade of unbelief which is
apt to lead the casual observer to wrong
conclusions. The real Russia is not to be
found in the towns, but in the villages and
hamlets and amongst the peasants. With
them the war is a religious war. It is a
battle between the Orthodox Church, which
is the peculiar property of the Slavs, and
the Western, which seeks to impose its
tenets on the “true believers.”</p>

<p>It is from these simple peasants with their
racial hatreds and rock-like faith that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Russia draws nine-tenths of her soldiers.
As fighting men they can be compared
only with Cromwell’s Ironsides.</p>

<p>In the rural districts the popular enthusiasm
for the war found an outlet in religion;
in the towns it sought a more secular form
of expression. Petrograd was the scene
of unprecedented outbursts of popular
jubilation. Crowds paraded the streets
singing the National Anthem and cheering
portraits of the Tzar. The French and
particularly the British Embassies were
besieged by cheering throngs. Every public
appearance of the Tzar was the sign for
vociferous outbursts of loyalty such as are
rarely witnessed in Russia. Even the
Empress, whose shattered nerves have
kept her virtually a prisoner for years, had
to come forward and bow her acknowledgments
to the crowds. And, to crown all,
the police, gendarmes and military were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
noticeably absent from the streets. The
crowds were orderly, in spite of their
patriotic fervour. Petrograd was as free
and unrestrained as London. It was difficult
to realise that only a few days before
the spectre of revolution had stalked through
the city.</p>

<p>One incident alone marred the demonstrations.
On August 4th, news reached
Petrograd of the scandalous treatment
undergone by the Russian diplomatic staff
at the hands of the Berlin mob. Enraged
beyond control a huge crowd descended
on the Nevski Prospect and after demolishing
a German café and several German-owned
shops, made a resolute attack on
the Embassy. The police were overpowered,
the gates forced and the work of destruction
began. The flagstaff was torn down, the
Prussian Eagle and several pieces of statuary
were unceremoniously thrown into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Moika Canal; furniture, pictures, linen,
books, everything that was inflammable was
heaped on the ground and soon a huge
bonfire was raging. Amidst a roar of
cheering a large portrait of the Kaiser was
hurled into the flames. The orgy continued
until the police and military appeared in
force. But the most significant feature
of the affair was the discovery in the cellars
of large stores of firearms and revolutionary
propaganda&mdash;concrete evidence that the suspicions
that Germany was fostering internal
troubles in Russia to serve her own ends
were only too well founded.</p>

<p>The most impressive of all the many
scenes emphasising the facts that not only
the Russian nation but all Slavdom is
united against the Teuton menace, and that
a new Russia is being built up as a result
of the common cause and danger, occurred
on Saturday, August 8th, when the Tzar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
received the two Houses of the Duma at
the Winter Palace. Early in the proceedings,
striking evidence was given of the
new order of things. Party quarrels, personal
jealousies and political enmities were
forgotten. The leader of every party came
forward and announced that he and his
followers would support the Government
by every means in their power. Even
M. Purishkivich, the implacable leader of
the Anti-Semite movement, abandoned his
principles and praised his Jewish fellow-subjects.</p>

<p>The Tzar’s speech was simple and direct,
but it was significant because of the stress
it laid upon the racial and religious aspects
of the war:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In these great days of alarms and
anxiety through which Russia is passing,
I greet you. Germany, following
Austria, has declared war on Russia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
The enormous enthusiasm and the
patriotic sentiments of love and faith
to the Throne, an enthusiasm which has
swept like a hurricane through our
country, is a guarantee for me, as for
you, I hope, that great Russia will
bring to a happy conclusion the war
which the Almighty has sent.</p>

<p>“It is also in this unanimous enthusiasm
of love and eagerness to make
every sacrifice, even life, that I am
able to regard the future with calm
and firmness. It is not only the
dignity and honour of our country
that we are defending, but we are
fighting for our brother Slavs, co-religionists,
and blood brethren. In
this moment I see also with joy that
the union of the Slavs with Russia
progresses strongly and indissolubly.</p>

<p>“I am persuaded that all and each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of you will be in your place to assist
me to support the test, and that all,
beginning with myself, will do their
duty. Great is the God of the Russian
Fatherland.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The effect of that ancient Russian saying
was electrical. The whole assembly burst
into a storm of cheering; this was followed
by “God save the Tzar,” sung with a
fervour which obviously affected his
Majesty. Finally that most beautiful of
all Russian anthems, “Lord, save the
People,” was sung. Tears streamed down
the cheeks of the deputies, as, with voices
choking with emotion and faith, they sang
the simple words of the anthem.</p>

<p>Such a scene of patriotic fervour and
national determination had not been witnessed
in Russia since the Napoleonic war
of 1812.</p>

<p>The practical enthusiasm of the nation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
was no less marked than the sentimental.
The wealthy classes contributed liberally
to the various relief funds, and made many
sacrifices to help the country in its time
of danger. In spite of the inconvenience
and dislocation of trade caused by the
military preparations, complaints were never
heard. The whole nation seemed to have combined
in a common determination to see the
war through to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>The gathering of the harvest provided
an instance of this practical enthusiasm.
Russia being the world’s largest producer
of wheat, barley, rye, and oats the matter
was a very urgent one. Moreover, Russia
is self-supporting, and the failure of the
crops would mean the ruin and starvation
of thousands during the winter months.
Most of the men had been called to the
colours, and there was a serious danger of
large portions of the crops, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
the more remote districts, being allowed to
rot for lack of labour. The problem was
attacked with a practical spirit unusual in
the Russian with his Asiatic fatalism.
The <i>zemstvos</i>, the military, and the local
authorities co-operated in dealing with this
problem. Women, boys, and old men were
set to work. Tramps and prisoners were
forcibly transformed into temporary harvesters.
By means of a central bureau in
each district it was possible to keep in
touch with every farm, no matter how
remote, and to ensure that no crops suffered
through lack of labour. As a result of
these measures the whole harvest was
successfully gathered, and the nation was
able to face the coming winter with the
satisfactory knowledge that, in any event,
its food supply was assured.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable effects of
the war on the nation was the complete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
change which came over its attitude towards
the Jews. Partly by reason of ancient
religious intolerance and partly because
of the fact that the Jews, thanks to the
thriftless and unbusinesslike methods of
the Russians, have managed to accumulate
much of the national wealth, the <i>Judiev</i>
hitherto have been regarded with fierce
animosity and subjected to pitiless persecution.
The story of the pogroms is one of
the most hideous chapters in the history
of any people. It was fully expected in
many quarters that the national enthusiasm
engendered by the war should find an
outlet in a repetition of these horrors.
Vienna indeed was so confident that it
officially informed the world that Vilna
was the scene of a terrible outbreak of
anti-semitism. The report was a lie. The
Jews were no longer the best hated race in
Russia; that distinction had been wrested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
from them by the “<i>Nemetz</i>.” Everywhere
a new tolerance and a new respect for the
Jews was apparent, especially when news
came of their heroic deeds at the front.
Their enthusiasm for the war and devotion
to the Tzar rivalled that of the Russians
themselves. A quarter of a million of
men&mdash;the largest Jewish army ever assembled
since the fall of Jerusalem&mdash;were
with the Tzar’s forces. Throughout the
country the Jews set a splendid example
in contributing to the relief funds and
in removing distress caused by the war.
Hence the Jew has become almost popular.
Even when, as a mark of Imperial appreciation
of their loyalty, ukases were issued
relieving them of many of the disadvantages
under which they suffered, and practically
admitting them to the full citizenship of
the Russian Empire, hardly a protesting
voice was heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Indeed, in many respects, the war has
been for Russia a blessing in disguise.
It has completed the work of the past few
years. On all sides reforms have been
effected and a new Russia has emerged.
The old ideals and the old standards have
passed. But the change has been unconscious,
and the Russians, with their chronic
fatalism, have not realised they have been
taking part in events which have practically
transformed the old autocratic regime into
one which is almost democratic. Some
external shock was needed to rouse the
nation to a sense of its new glories. The
war provided that shock, and Russia and
the world have realised that a new era has
dawned in the dominions of the Tzar.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Mobilisation</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mobilisation in Russia is an inevitably
slow and difficult operation. The circumstances
under which it is effected render it
almost impossible to reduce it to a matter
of automatic precision, as is the case with
the German Army. It is typically Russian:
rather ponderous and very human. The
chances of its being successfully and quickly
accomplished are so slight compared with
those of its proving an orgy of confusion
and disorganisation that nobody, least of
all in Russia itself, where businesslike
methods are not expected of officials of any
sort, dared hope that it would be carried
out without a hitch. The Allies were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
apprehensive, the Kaiser was openly contemptuous
and left only second-line troops
to guard his eastern frontiers until Russia
could extricate her army from the inevitable
confusion and be worthy of the attentions
of the perfect Teutonic fighting machine.</p>

<p>The German, of course, with his keen
materialism, has a reputation for doing
these things with an automatic efficiency.
The Slav, on the other hand, is of a very
different temperament, and the Tzar’s army
has acquired, and deserved, a reputation
for mismanagement. It is the most human
of armies, for certainly there never was one
more given to error. The Manchurian
campaign was one of the worst muddles of
modern times. In comparison, the South
African War was a model of efficient
management. It was always a case of the
wrong thing at the wrong moment: and
even when there appeared to be a chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of the right thing happening, corruption or
ineptitude stepped in and stultified every
effort. Those who happened to be in
Russia during that period will remember
that hardly a day passed without some
fresh instance of the national habit of
blundering through. The railways were in
a state of frantic disorganisation; whole
regiments got mislaid; food and clothing
were always lacking in spite of the most
lavish expenditure. Worst of all, numerous
officials and Jewish contractors became
suddenly and mysteriously wealthy, and
made small secret of the source of their
prosperity.</p>

<p>Nobody raised his voice in protest because
nobody had expected anything different.
The orgy of mismanagement was accepted
with a good-humoured shrug of the
shoulders. <i>Nitchevo</i>, it can’t be helped!
That was the comment of the fatalism which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
is at once the greatest weakness and greatest
strength of the Russian character.</p>

<p>Of course, there was excuse enough.
Mobilisation is carried on in the face of
more difficulties in Russia than in any other
country. Everything militates against its
speed and efficiency. It is all on so vast
a scale that it would seem impossible for
human ingenuity to place it on a systematised
basis. The area of the Russian Empire
is forty times that of Germany, but its
population is only three times as great.
The units to be concentrated are diffusely
scattered; they have to be gathered singly.
The aggregate length of the Russian railway
system is only twice that of the German
lines, and few of the Russian railways
have been laid with a view to meeting
military needs. The majority of the troops
summoned to the colours have to traverse
vast distances, often on foot, before they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
can reach the railway which will take them
to their mobilisation centres. The sparseness
of the population renders it difficult
for orders to filter through, and still more
difficult for troops to be quickly concentrated.
A good deal must of necessity
be left to the zeal and initiative of the
reservists themselves who, in most cases,
are utterly unreliable without supervision.</p>

<p>At the best, therefore, with good weather
and good luck, the mobilisation is but a
slow process. Previous to the present war
the most obstinate optimist did not believe
that, in the most favourable circumstances,
it could be completed in less than three
weeks or a month.</p>

<p>In the present case, too, there were
special aggravating circumstances which
rendered success all the more doubtful.
July had been a month of labour disputes,
and it seemed more than likely that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
strikes would seriously hamper the mobilisation.
Moreover, the Russian military plans
were incomplete. A programme of reform
was being pushed forward with all possible
speed, but it was not to be completed until
1916, at least. The army was in a state of
transition. A new system was being imposed
upon it, and it was by no means
ready for the supreme test. There was a
general feeling that it would be better to
rely on the old system which, whatever its
defects, had at least the merits of being
known and understood. A partial muddle
was better than the risk of absolute chaos.</p>

<p>The order for mobilisation, therefore,
could not have come at a more inopportune
time. Russia, in spite of all official assurances
to the contrary, was unprepared.</p>

<p>It is well known that this inevitable
slowness and possible impotence on the part
of Russia during the early period of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
war was the foundation on which the
Kaiser constructed his plan of campaign.
He could, so he thought, smash the Allies in
the West and return in time to mete out
similar treatment to the Russians before
they could do any damage in the East.
Everything favoured the plan, which had
all the merits of simplicity and conciseness.
Nobody who was acquainted with the disadvantages
under which Russia laboured
could deny that, humanly speaking, Germany
was immune from a serious attack
from Russia for at least six weeks. Even
that estimate seemed to err on the side of
optimism, for at that time there was no
reason to suppose that Austria would have
much difficulty in defeating Serbia and
menacing Russia with a strong advance.</p>

<p>But among the many factors with which
the Kaiser omitted to reckon must be included
General Soukhomlinov&mdash;the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Kitchener, as he has, not inaptly, been
called.</p>

<p>When the disastrous Manchurian campaign
was ended, Russia sadly needed a
man who could take to heart the lessons of
defeat and build up a new and better army
from the discredited fragments of the old.
The moment produced the man. Soukhomlinov,
the greatest War Minister Russia has
known, has for the past nine years been
engaged on an immense scheme for the remodelling
and reorganising of the army.
Quietly and with inexorable efficiency, he
has cut away cancer after cancer and
added reform to reform. No problem has
been too large, no detail too trivial, and no
circumstance too hopeless, for him to
devote to it his tireless energy. The whole
military system from top to bottom, and in
every nook and cranny, has been renovated.</p>

<p>Soukhomlinov’s greatest merit is that, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
planning and carrying this huge scheme
into effect, he has not fallen into the trap
that lurks in the path of every military
reformer. Although working on western
lines, he has not attempted to imitate the
German or any other army. That would
have been the obvious course for a man of
less genius. But Soukhomlinov had the
greatness to realise that an imitation army
can never be satisfactory. An army must
be national to the core, or it will fail in its
object. “What is health to the Russian
is death to the German,” is a Russian saying
that is very true. And an attempt to
force Teuton temperaments into Slav bodies
would result only in a bastard production
emphasising the defects of both.</p>

<p>Soukhomlinov knew that the Russian
is the finest soldier in the world. His
bravery, his unquestioning obedience, his
infinite capacity for suffering and hardship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
his stolid fatalism which makes him the
same in victory or defeat, all these qualities
render him an ideal fighting man. German
helmets or the goose step would not add
one jot to his virtues. He has never had a
chance, because he has never been properly
led or properly organised. It is in these
two directions, therefore, that General
Soukhomlinov has concentrated his efforts.
Under the new regime the Russian officer
has been transformed. The army is no
longer a hobby for fashionable young men,
but a stern business in which slackers and
the inept are not wanted. The habit of
heavy drinking at night&mdash;which during the
Manchurian campaign so often resulted in
such heavy slaughter in the morning&mdash;is a
thing of the past. The army requires clear
heads, and Soukhomlinov has no use for
befuddled officers.</p>

<p>Efficient organisation is as vital to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
army as efficient leadership, and the greatest
test of organisation is the mobilisation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="400" height="327" alt="Mobilization diagram" />
</div>

<p>Owing to the speed with which Germany
and Austria can effect their mobilisation,
Russia must of necessity begin a European
war on the defensive. Consequently, her
mobilisation bases are not situated on the
frontier, but at a considerable distance in
the interior, at Warsaw, and other towns
lying behind the Vistula. These towns are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
protected by a long chain of fortresses and
fortified positions, stretching from Kovno
to Radom, and designed to hold an invading
force in check until the troops have been
mobilised and the advance can begin.</p>

<p>The method by which the mobilisation
is effected will be understood by reference
to the diagram. At the call to arms
recruits and reservists living at the outlying
hamlets, <i>a a a</i>, make their way to the
central villages and towns, <i>b b</i>. This journey
has usually to be performed on foot, and
may be anything up to fifty miles. At
<i>b b</i> the men are collected in batches and
passed on to the concentration centres,
<i>c c c</i>. For this journey railways are sometimes
available, but in the more remote
districts the roads are, more often than not,
the only means of communication. The
peasant soldiers troop into the concentration
centres in their ordinary dress, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
leave them ready for the field. All day
long a constant stream of peasants is pouring
into the barracks, and a constant stream
of soldiers, fully equipped for hostilities,
is pouring out. Regiments and battalions
are formed. Then, when all is complete,
they pass on by train to the mobilisation
base <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>The success of the system obviously depends
on the maintenance of an even flow
of men from <i>a</i> and <i>D</i>. A delay or hitch
at any point may throw the whole process
out of gear. The area covered is so vast,
the population so sparse, the army so huge,
and the means of communication from
point to point leave so much to be desired
that difficulties and dangers spring up in
every direction. An especially weak point
about the system is that in the early stages
so much depends upon the men themselves.</p>

<p>Ivan Ivan’ich, the Russian Tommy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Atkins, is no better and no worse than the
rank and file of any army. He is not
averse to temptation, especially when it
takes the form of alcohol. Vodka was the
cause of much of the muddle of the Manchurian
mobilisation. In the present instance,
however, General Soukhomlinov
very wisely decided to take no risks. He
decided on a bold stroke which, in the unsettled
state of the country at the beginning
of the war, might easily have been the
cause of serious rioting. The Imperial
ukase ordering the mobilisation was followed
by another which practically prohibited the
sale of alcohol in all districts likely to be
affected by the military preparations. The
railway stations, concentration centres, and
mobilisation bases were signalled out for
specially stringent regulations. There were
also severe pains and penalties for those who,
in their patriotic fervour, were inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
be over-generous to the troops on their way
to the front.</p>

<p>This drastic measure was fully justified
by the results. With nothing to delay
them, the men arrived punctually at their
posts. They were sober, and displayed all
the virtues of sobriety. Their health and
temper were noticeably improved. There
were none of the quarrels and disturbances
usually associated with mobilisation. The
conduct of the troops was in every way
irreproachable. The worries and work of
the officers were lightened a hundredfold.</p>

<p>Russia, in short, provided the world
with an object lesson in the value of
temperance.</p>

<p>Of course there was some grumbling.
Men who had tramped fifty versts or so to
serve the “Little Father” thought that
they were at least entitled to drink his
health and damnation to the <i>Nemetz</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
But generally the order of things was
accepted with the unquestioning stolidness
of the Russian peasant. The “Little
Father” had said, “No vodka”&mdash;therefore,
<i>nitchevo</i>, why complain?</p>

<p>The following description of the actual
mobilisation is based upon the letters
written by Vasili Grigorovich, the cobbler
of a little town in the Ukraine, to an
English friend. The bond between this
rather ill-assorted pair is Vasili’s unsatiable
thirst for learning. Self-taught, he reads
everything and anything that comes his
way, and it was a chance conversation over
an out-of-date newspaper during the mending
of the traveller’s boot that led to the
friendship.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The news that a general mobilisation
was ordered reached the village
late in the afternoon. The Governor
himself came to tell us that the ‘Little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Father’ is at war with the <i>Nemetz</i>,
and that we must all start off for Berlin
at once. He is a witty man, our
Governor. I started getting ready, but
Marya scolded me for not being quick
enough. Indeed, she scolded me all
the time, even when I bade her goodbye.
That’s like our women. They
always hide their heartaches. And
after all they are quite right, for
what are their sorrows compared with
the orders of the Tzar? She swore
at me and said I was not fit to be
a soldier, when I kissed her. But
her voice was thick and her eyes
glistened. And Dimitri, who caught
me up later, told me that when he
passed he saw her praying before our
ikon. It was the first time, too, that
he had seen Marya weeping.</p>

<p>“She is a fine woman, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
outwardly rough. I am very glad to
hear that the Tzar has ordered that the
wives and families of the soldiers shall
be well supplied with money. He is
a great Tzar. However, it will be very
lonely for Marya all through the winter,
and if it were not for thinking of her
I should be quite happy.</p>

<p>“Dimitri and I had to tramp
thirty-two versts&mdash;a good stretch. We
went some distance out of our way to
reach an inn. But it was closed by
the Tzar’s orders. Well, the Little
Father knows best.</p>

<p>“We decided to walk all through
the night, because we both wanted to
be fighting the <i>Nemetz</i> as soon as
possible. We had not gone far before
a farm cart full of soldiers caught us
up and they gave us a lift. It was
rather cold, but we did not mind. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
talked about the war, and the news
about the inns. We are sure to win,
but it is rather hard on the innkeepers,
who will lose a lot of money. However,
they are all rich.</p>

<p>“We reached &mdash;&mdash; before dawn.
The officer there was very surprised,
because the men from our district were
not supposed to arrive until late in
the evening. He was rather cross too,
because everybody was coming too
soon, and upsetting the arrangements.
However, a landed proprietor offered
his mansion for the use of the soldiers.
Fancy that!</p>

<p>“The next day we marched to &mdash;&mdash;,
where there is a railway station. There
are no trains for the ordinary passengers,
because the Tzar has taken them
all for the soldiers. Fifty trainloads of
soldiers are passing through &mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
every day! Dimitri said we should be
able to get drinks at the station, but
he was wrong. I hear now that it is
a crime to give vodka to the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Our train was very full, because
of the men all being so early. It was
rather uncomfortable, but we were all
too glad to be going to the front to
notice it. At one station two boys,
who had run away from home and
wanted to fight, were discovered by
an officer and turned out. They were
very disappointed, but there was more
room for us.</p>

<p>“At last, after sixteen hours,
we reached &mdash;&mdash;. At first we
thought that there was no accommodation
for us, but we found that a
camp had been prepared for us. The
town was very full of soldiers, but they
were all very orderly and quiet. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
day after our arrival we received our
new uniforms, rifles and other things.
The uniforms are very smart, something
like the English, I am told.
The boots, too, are excellent. The
very best leather. It is evidently true
that the Tzar has made our army better
than ever it was. It is a bad lookout
for the <i>Nemetz</i>. In these uniforms
and boots we shall be able to chase
them all the way to Berlin quite comfortably.</p>

<p>“Our regiment is complete. To-morrow
we start for Warsaw, where
our Army Corps is forming. In a few
days we shall meet the <i>Nemetz</i>.
Good-bye.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the Cossacks, who are, of course,
a less reliable people than the ordinary
peasants, the mobilisation was no less
smooth. A Government official in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Ural provinces gives a vivid account of the
scenes. The Cossacks, it may be noted,
supply their own horses, uniforms and
equipment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On July 31st the village awoke
to find a red flag waving before the
Government building, the sign that a
general mobilisation had been ordered.
Immediately everything was in a state
of uproar. Nobody knew who was
the enemy and nobody cared. It was
sufficient that there was war. Only
the women made wild conjectures as
to whom it was against. There was
no thought for work. Horses were
groomed, uniforms donned, rifles and
sabres cleaned with enthusiastic vigour.
Soon the Government veterinary surgeon
took his stand before the chief
building and the work of examining
the horses began. Each man in turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
brought up his horse and put it through
its paces. The test was most strict,
and any animal showing the slightest
defect was promptly branded as useless.
All day the work continued, a
crowd of women and children watching
the proceedings. At night the red
flag was pulled down and a red lamp
was hoisted in its place. In the
evening there was a great feast. A
whole ox was roasted, there was
dancing among the younger people,
but owing to the new regulations
there was practically no vodka. All
through the night men came riding
into the village from the outlying
districts.</p>

<p>“On the Sunday when the preparations
were almost complete the consecration
service was held. The whole
village assembled before the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
wooden church. It was a stirring
sight to see these great warriors in
their full battle array kneeling before
their Maker and solemnly asking His
aid. At the conclusion of the service
each man was blessed by the priest
and anointed with holy water. Then
he led his horse away and received
the blessings of his family.</p>

<p>“On the following day they set off
on journey of thousands of miles.
The women, children and old men
watched them. Their eyes gleamed
with tears and their breasts heaved.
Then, when the last man had disappeared
from view, they turned away,
walked to the fields and took over the
labours which the men had left unfinished.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the simple narrative of Vasili Grigorovich
and the description of the Cossack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
scenes may be found all the causes which
contributed to the startling success of the
Russian mobilisation.</p>

<p>The organisation, thanks to the genius
of Soukhomlinov, proved perfect. The
smallest detail had been prepared, and
every possibility foreseen. In no direction
was there any fluster or confusion. The
commissariat and transport arrangements
worked splendidly; the equipment of the
troops with the new service uniform&mdash;an
idea borrowed from the results of Britain’s
South African experiences&mdash;was an unqualified
success. The uniform has been designed
for business purposes only, and with
no regard for show. It is very similar to
the British uniform; the chief differences
being that the Russian tunics are looser, and
in place of puttees, long boots are worn.
Special attention has been given to this
latter detail. Manchuria taught Russia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
to realise the advantages enjoyed by a well-shod
army.</p>

<p>But perhaps the greatest triumph of the
mobilisation was the prompt and businesslike
way in which the financial question was
settled. All who had suffered any loss
as a result of the dislocation of trade and
traffic caused by the requisition of the railways
and other means of transport, were
recompensed without delay. By utilising
the organisation of the zemstvos or local
councils, it was possible to prevent all distress
and to make ample provision for the
wives, families, and other dependants of
the men called to the colours. Indeed, in
Moscow and Southern Russia money has
seldom been so plentiful as it was during the
period of the mobilisation, and many
families are better off now than they ever
were.</p>

<p>Another contributing cause was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
conduct and efficiency of both officers and
men. The former proved that they have taken
the reforms of the last few years thoroughly
to heart. The latter showed that even the
lowest ranks felt that they were “Soukhomlinov’s
men.” To some extent, of
course, their efficiency was due to their
enforced sobriety. But much of it arose
from an honest determination to rise to the
occasion. Ivan Ivan’ich is taking this
war very seriously. He is calmly confident
of his ability to win, and he is immensely
proud of the new army, of which he is a
member. Moreover, he had an unlimited
enthusiasm for the war. He was anxious
to be killing the hated <i>Nemetz</i>, who
threatened his own liberty and that of his
brother Slavs, and he knew that the better
he behaved the sooner he would be at the
front. There was no mistaking his eagerness
to do the right thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
The following is an extract from the
diary of a traveller, who spent nearly thirty
hours in Kiev waiting for a train to be available
for civilian passengers to Petrograd.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Everywhere there are soldiers.
There must be tens of thousands of
infantry, cavalry and artillery. They
are constantly on the move. In their
peasant blouses, baggy trousers, and
birch-bark shoes, they pour in ceaseless
streams into the barracks, where
they are served with their equipment.
They issue forth transformed into as
smart soldiers as could be wished. All
the uniforms are new, and appear to
be made of excellent material. They
are greyish khaki in hue, and not
unlike the British service uniform in
appearance. Seven million brand-new
uniforms of the finest quality! That
gives some idea of the millions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Russia has been quietly spending on
her army!</p>

<p>“The men are as proud as peacocks,
and tremendously in earnest. Ivan
Ivanovich is a very important person
just now, and he knows it. Physically,
he is splendid. Seldom tall, but always
thick-set and well proportioned,
he is a first-class fighting man, and,
with his experience of Russia’s climate,
he can endure practically any hardship.
I doubt if there are any troops living
who will suffer more and grumble less.
That is the advantage of being a
Russian. And it is all done on the
most frugal of vegetarian diets! What
would our Tommies say to a diet of
black bread and fermented cabbage!</p>

<p>“Those who doubted Russia’s military
value should spend a few hours in
Kiev and note how regiment after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
regiment marches through with never
the slightest hitch or confusion. They
should see these sturdy Tommies, with
their cruel rapier like bayonets always
fixed. They should hear their deep-throated
war chants. Then they would
realise that Russia is going to play a
very important part in this war....”</p></blockquote>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the nation
itself was largely responsible for the success
of the mobilisation. The self-sacrificing
enthusiasm of all classes was a revelation to
those who believed that Russia was in a
parlous condition internally. The inevitable
losses and inconvenience were
cheerfully borne. The rich came forward
in a wholly unprecedented manner. In
Russia, owing to the lack of a middle class,
the distinction between noble and peasant
is most rigorously observed. The old days
of the serfdom have not been entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
forgotten. But during those early weeks
of August the national call was responded
to with equal enthusiasm by rich and poor.
Mansions were placed at the disposal of
the peasant soldiers. Food and gifts were
showered upon them; even carriages were
offered to help them on their way. The
owner of an estate near Novgorod, not only
entertained, at his own expense, nearly
three hundred troops a day, but his wife
and daughters served them with their
own hands. A year ago such an action
would have meant social ostracism. To-day
it is an example which is being followed
everywhere.</p>

<p>This <i>rapprochement</i> between the classes
will have effects extending far beyond the
mobilisation. They give promise of a new
and happier Russia, for Ivan Ivan’ich
never forgets a kindness.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the people was evinced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
in a thousand different ways. There was
cheering and singing everywhere, but
practical enthusiasm was no less in evidence.
Often it resulted in trouble. The impersonation
of reservists who had been called
up, by those who had not, was very frequent.
In many cases the discovery of
the trick ended in blows with the result
that neither proceeded to the front, the
impersonator going to gaol and the impersonated
to the hospital. Thousands of
boys ran away from their homes in order to
enlist. Some Polish boys living at Vilna
were so disappointed at being refused
admission to the army on account of their
age that they formed themselves into an
unofficial patrol. Unfortunately they fell
in with some Austrian Cavalry, and the
next day their bodies were discovered
hanging from the branches of a tree.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm was not confined to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
men. Women and girls sacrificed their
tresses and disguised themselves as recruits.
Some actually managed to reach the
front without being detected, and one even
contrived to enter the air service.</p>

<p>At no time during the mobilisation was
the religious aspect of the war allowed to
be forgotten. Before starting on their
journey reservists knelt before their humble
ikons. In every village the priest blessed
the troops as they passed. Ikons and
sacred relics have been taken to the front.</p>

<p>Petrograd witnessed the most impressive
scenes. The most holy of all ikons, the
famous Smolensk, “Mother of God,” which
is embellished with jewels enough to
ransom the Tzar himself, was carried in
solemn procession to Kazan Cathedral.
Hundreds of thousands stood in the streets
through which the ikon passed. Every
head was bared, a muttered prayer was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
on every lip. Thousands were unable to
gain admission into the cathedral during
the services, and gathered in the square
outside, sometimes to the extent of fifty
thousand, chanting the responses and singing
the hymns. On the Sunday following
the declaration of war, the Tzar blessed
the Russian arms and those of the Allies.
The flags of the nations were placed on
the altar before the Smolensk ikon, and
with all the Byzantine pomp and circumstance
of the Greek ritual the aid of the
Almighty was invoked.</p>

<p>Thus in most gratifying circumstances
the news went forth that Russia was ready.
The mobilisation was sufficiently complete
to warrant an advance. The date was
August 16th, barely a fortnight after the
issue of the general mobilisation order and
a full month sooner than the Kaiser had
calculated. The number of men in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
field cannot be stated with accuracy.
Experts have talked glibly of millions, but
none know the exact number of Russia’s
fighting men except the Russian General
Staff, and doubtless the German. Four
million men in the field and a further
three million in reserve may be taken as
a likely estimate.</p>

<p>In any case the mobilisation was the
finest feat of the war. It was a triumph
over almost insuperable difficulties and a
miracle of national organisation and effort.
It was the most significant and most
threatening of the many clouds which
were beginning to gather round Germany.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Polish Proclamation</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>On August 15th the Grand Duke Nicholas
issued, on behalf of the Tzar, the following
Proclamation addressed to all the Poles:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Poles</span>,&mdash;The hour has sounded
when the sacred dream of your fathers
and your grandfathers may be realised.
A century and a half has passed since
the living body of Poland was torn
in pieces, but the soul of the country
is not dead. It continues to live,
inspired by the hope that there will
come for the Polish people an hour of
resurrection, and of fraternal reconciliation
with Great Russia. The
Russian Army brings you the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
news of this reconciliation which
obliterates the frontiers dividing the
Polish peoples, which it unites conjointly
under the sceptre of the Russian
Tzar. Under this sceptre Poland will
be born again, free in her religion and
her language. Russian autonomy only
expects from you the same respect for
the rights of those nationalities to which
history has bound you. With open
heart and brotherly hand Great Russia
advances to meet you. She believes
that the sword, with which she struck
down her enemies at Grünwald, is not
yet rusted. From the shores of the
Pacific to the North Sea the Russian
armies are marching. The dawn of a
new life is beginning for you, and in
this glorious dawn is seen the sign of
the Cross, the symbol of suffering and
of the resurrection of peoples.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
This master stroke of policy was one of
the most significant and important events
in the whole war. It has revolutionised the
whole outlook in Eastern Europe. This
pledge to restore to dismembered Poland
her lands, her liberties, her religion and her
national tongue is the most momentous act
of any Tzar since the days when Alexander II.
abolished the serfdom. With dramatic suddenness
it brings to a close one of the most
terrible chapters in the history of Europe.
For generations Russia has been engaged in
a ruthless and vain attempt to force her
Polish subjects to become, at least to all
outward appearance, Russians. The Poles
have been subjected to the fiercest persecution,
their religion and language have been
denied them, their history has been a stream
of blood. Poland has been the greatest
tragedy in Europe. Now at a stroke all is
changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
The spoliation of Poland has been a bond
between Russia, Austria and Prussia for a
century and a half. The three nations
combined to carry out the crime, and as a
consequence they have ever since remained
more or less united over the results of the
crime. They have regarded the Polish
question as their own particular concern,
and have brooked no interference from the
rest of Europe. They have vied with each
other in their efforts to crush the Polish
spirit. They have made every move in
unison.</p>

<p>The Tzar’s Proclamation consigned the
whole system to the limbo of the past. One
of the conspirators had realised the errors
of his ways, and was determined to make
reparation. Of course, the decision to
issue the Proclamation was to a large extent
dictated by material considerations. But
whatever the reasons, there can be no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
doubt as to the excellence of the results.
And by thus breaking the bond of generations
Russia proved that she realised that
this war was to be fought to the death.
After this solemn pledge on the part of
Russia, both Germany and Austria must
not only be beaten, but conquered. A free
Poland would mean the loss to Prussia of
the whole province of Posen, and the setting
back of her frontiers to Pomerania. Austria
would lose all her territories beyond the
Carpathians from Silesia to the borders of
Roumania. Both countries can be relied
upon to resist such a wholesale shrinkage
of their boundaries to the utmost of their
power. It would be more than a defeat;
it would be humiliation, such as no first-class
Power has yet been called upon to
undergo.</p>

<p>The effects of the Proclamation were
anxiously awaited, not only in Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
but in Germany and Austria as well. It
was addressed to the most sacred emotions
of the Poles, to that fierce patriotism which
no violence has been able to crush. It
solemnly promised them all that they have
been struggling for so bitterly. But would
they forget the past? The treatment they
have received would hardly be likely to
encourage trust. Massacres and repression
are not usually associated with the “dawn
of a new life.”</p>

<p>The Polish Deputies immediately hailed
the Proclamation with joy. But the
people hesitated. It was too sudden a
change to be grasped at once. Then the
leaders set the example, first one and then
another came forward. Sienkiewicz addressed
a stirring appeal to his compatriots.
The people realised that the promise was
genuine, that Poland was really to be free
again. Scenes of indescribable enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
followed. The Poles are the most emotional
nation in Europe, and from Kalisz to Biala
and from Mlava to Stopnika they abandoned
themselves to their joy. Thereafter the
Polish enthusiasm for the war vied with that
of the Russians themselves. The effect was
immediately felt in the army. In one of
the early dispatches received at Petrograd
from the front, mention was made of the
furious heroism of the Polish regiments. In
Russia, therefore, the results of the Proclamation
were to remove the last shreds
of apathy and to weld both the subjects
and the armies of the Tzar into one pulsating
whole.</p>

<p>But the appeal was also addressed to the
Polish subjects of the Kaiser and the
Emperor Francis Joseph. It was an open
invitation to them to revolt. In the circumstances,
the German and Austrian Poles
who have so often experienced Teutonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
methods of stamping out rebellion, can
hardly be blamed for accepting the proposal
in a cautious spirit. They were quite unprepared
for open rebellion, and at the best
would have stood but little chance of
success against the armies already mobilised
in their midst. In addition, the cream of
their manhood was with the forces of the
Kaiser and Emperor. Only in Austria did
a Polish regiment dare to mutiny, with the
result that it was shot down to a man.
For the rest, wiser if less heroic counsels
prevailed. Everything possible was done
covertly to assist the Russian advance.
Both German and Austrian commanders
complained of the extreme activity of
innumerable spies, lamented that the whole
population seemed to have combined in
an effort to be of every possible service to
the enemy, and admitted that fighting in
Eastern Prussia and Galicia was fraught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
with all the difficulties attending operations
in a hostile country.</p>

<p>But the Proclamation, and the obvious
sincerity which prompted it, have had
effects extending far beyond military
exigencies and the future of the Poles.
It has done more than anything else
to raise Russia in the estimation of the
world. The oppression of Poland has always
estranged the leading democracies
of the world from Russia. In France it was
used as an argument against the Franco-Russian
alliance, in Britain it has caused the
Triple Entente to be regarded as a potential
danger to ourselves. At the time of the
war with Japan it withheld the sympathy
of the United States from Russia. Now
all is changed. The Proclamation was received
with approbation by the whole
world, with the exception, of course, of
Germany and Austria. It was realised by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
all that Russia is indeed advancing, that
the short-sighted autocratic government is
giving way to the finest ideals of democracy,
and that Russia is an ally worthy of the
most ardent lover of liberty.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Preliminary Phase</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Apart from the initial handicap of having
to fight on the defensive because of the
comparative slowness of her mobilisation,
Russia is the most advantageously situated
of all European Powers for war on the
grand scale. Britain is dependent on her
command of the sea for her food and trade;
the existence of both France and Germany
more or less depend on supplies from the
outer world. But Russia is self-contained.
Her vast “lump” of empire can supply all
her needs, from food and trade to an
unlimited store of first-class fighting material.
Mainly agricultural and possessing
a comparatively small foreign trade, Russia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
could face with equanimity a war of any
duration. Until the end of the seventeenth
century Russia was the Tibet of Europe,
and practically cut off from the rest of the
world. She could, with very little inconvenience,
retire again behind her frontiers
and bid defiance to the world. Time has
always been her greatest ally, and her
strategy is based upon utilising that ally
to the utmost.</p>

<p>The boundaries between the Tzar’s
dominions and those of Germany and Austria
are, for the most part, purely artificial.
They follow no distinct line of demarcation.
The great Russian plain extends far into
Prussia and Austria, and along the whole
length of the frontiers the only obstacles
to the advance of an invading army are
forests, marshes and the fact that generally
speaking the roads are very poor.</p>

<p>Each country has had, therefore, to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
defensive measures to remedy the deficiencies
of nature. Russia has the chain of
fortresses and fortified positions, extending
from Kovno to Radom, which are intended
to hold an invading force in check until the
mobilisation can be completed. Special
attention has of late years been given to
the defence of the north-western frontier.
Plans have been drawn up for the construction
of more fortresses and of strategic
railways and military roads. But these
works are not yet in a sufficiently advanced
state to serve any practical end in the
present war.</p>

<p>Germany, realising the significance of
Russia’s military reorganisation, has recently
spent huge sums on strengthening her
eastern frontiers. The works are by no
means complete, but they are more advanced
and of more practical service than those on
the Russian side of the frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
To the south where Russia and Austria
meet, neither Power has taken or contemplated
taking any such extensive measures
for defence. Cracow, Lemberg and Przemysl
are the only fortresses of any value in
Galicia, and they are faced by fortifications
of about equal strength on the Russian side.</p>

<p>Russia, however, possesses a very great
advantage over Austria, and in lesser degree
over Germany, in that the inhabitants of
Galicia and Eastern Prussia are mostly of
Slavonic origin and therefore more or less
strongly in sympathy with Russia. The
Poles being members of the Catholic Church
and having strong nationalistic aspirations,
the bond is less strong in their case. But
reference has already been made to the
results of the Russian Proclamation, and it
will be seen therefore that both Germany
and Austria are under the disadvantage of
having to defend hostile territories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
At the moment when war was declared,
Russia had nine army corps, or about
400,000 men guarding her western frontiers.
Three corps were stationed at Warsaw, and
one each at Vilna, Grodno, Bialystok,
Minsk, Lublin, Rovno and Vinnitza. In
addition to these troops, there were three
army corps at Kiev and one at Odessa.
There was thus available for immediate
hostilities a total of about 600,000 men.
Against these Germany and Austria could
muster about 400,000 men. There were
German army corps at Königsberg, Dantzig,
Posen, Breslau, Allenstein and Stettin.
The Austrian corps were at Cracow, Lemberg
and Przemysl. This numerical advantage
on the side of Russia was further
increased by the withdrawal of some of
the German corps for service in the western
campaign. Russia might, therefore, have
made an immediate attack on Prussia with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
every prospect of success. But she refrained.
In the first place, time was not
of such particular importance as to warrant
the taking of any risks. In the second
place Russia needed all her energies for the
successful completion of the mobilisation.
And finally there was the Austrian menace.</p>

<p>Theoretically Austria could muster her
two and a half million men, and invade
Russia long before the latter’s mobilisation
was complete. To Austria, then, was assigned
the task of maintaining the prestige
and reputation of the Mailed Fist in Eastern
Europe. Russian Poland was to be invaded,
Warsaw captured and the Russian
army kept at bay until the conquerors of
France could come and complete their
victorious work. Unfortunately for the
success of the plan, however, Austria could
not get her rheumatic knuckles into the
famous gauntlet. Even Serbia, exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
though she was after two hard-fought wars,
proved more than a match for Austria.
And when the latter attempted to advance
into Russia, she found herself more or less
paralysed by her old enemy&mdash;internal dissension.</p>

<p>In Russia the war was the signal for all
internal animosities to vanish and to leave
the nation pulsating with one determination.
In Austria the reverse was the effect. All
semblance of unity and loyalty in the
eastern provinces disappeared, the crisis
tore aside the artificial bonds and Austria
stood revealed for what she was and always
has been&mdash;a ramshackle collection of wrangling
races and creeds.</p>

<p>Francis Joseph is the nominal ruler of a
heterogeneous collection of Germans, Magyars,
Czechs, Poles, Ruthenians, Serbs,
Slovaks, Croatians, Rumanians and Italians.
Of a total population of fifty-three millions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
half are Slavs. And it was with an army
drawn from all these sources that Austria
sought to invade Russia, the protector of
all the Slavs. She foresaw the likelihood
of trouble, and took measures accordingly.
The outbreak of the war was the signal for
a reign of terror to begin in Dalmatia,
Bosnia and Croatia and other Slav provinces.
In order to get the inhabitants
under military control and to take the
sting out of any revolutionary movement,
all the men up to the age of fifty were
mobilised. The newspapers were suppressed;
clubs and societies, even the
most harmless, were dissolved. The people
were forbidden to leave the towns and
villages; the leading Slavs were seized,
imprisoned and held as hostages.</p>

<p>But even these ruthless measures could
not crush the rebellious spirit of the Slavs.
In Herzegovina the murder of some government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
officials was followed by a wholesale
slaughter of priests held by the authorities
as hostages. Everywhere there were savage
acts of rebellion followed by more savage
acts of reprisal. In the army matters
reached a climax. The Slav regiments
mutinied. Concerted action was impossible
owing to the fact that the authorities kept
the Slav regiments separated and disposed
their loyal Teuton and Magyar regiments
in the most advantageous positions for
quelling any mutiny on the part of their
“comrades.” Nevertheless thousands of
Slavs mutinied rather than fight against
their brothers. They were shot to a man.
In some cases whole regiments refused to
serve and were promptly exterminated.
The mutinous spirit spread to Poland and
Bohemia. In Prague there were daily executions
and the Moldava ran red with
Czech blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
These measures of wholesale murder
were effective. The Slav regiments were
driven to the front at the points of their
“comrades” bayonets. But Austria’s
plans were already wrecked. The mutinous
spirit of her army had caused the mobilisation
to break down. Time was valuable;
the Russian mobilisation was pressing forward
to its triumphant conclusion. The
project of invading Russia and capturing
Poland became daily less likely of accomplishment.</p>

<p>The campaign in the east therefore,
opened in the most inauspicious circumstances
for the Mailed Fist. All was well
with Russia and all was wrong with Austria.
The troops were sullen and utterly lacking
in the fighting spirit; they were badly led
and their equipment left much to be desired.
The Kaiser realised that in relying on
Austria he had made another serious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
miscalculation. Instead of being a useful ally
she appeared far more likely to prove a
millstone about his neck. Cripples are of
little use in war. Desperate efforts were
made to obtain more satisfactory help.
Italy and Turkey were alternately coaxed
and bullied. The world was deluged with
a frantic flood of wireless lies which were
obviously designed to attract help from
anywhere. But they were all in vain.
Fate seemed to have taken especial care to
have the last word.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Germany had to content
herself with an attempt to revitalise the
Austrian millions. At any rate the material
was there, if only it could be forced into
shape. So German officers were requisitioned
for the Austrian army.</p>

<p>The operations during this preliminary
phase of the war, during which Russian
effort was concentrated upon preparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
for the coming advance, were necessarily
of a somewhat desultory and unimportant
nature. They were interesting chiefly as
showing in what way subsequent and more
important fighting would be likely to
develop.</p>

<p>For some days nothing more exciting
occurred than a few collisions between
patrols guarding the frontiers. Then, on
August 3rd, the Germans made a definite
move. A small force from Lublinitz, a
town near the point where the Russian,
German, and Austrian frontiers meet,
crossed into Russia and occupied Tchenstochov.
Further to the north other
German forces seized Bendzin and Kalish,
in Poland. Russia immediately answered
this move by making a cavalry raid into
Prussia, with the result that Johannisburg
was occupied and a rather important railway
was broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The Germans, however, continued to be
aggressive. Numerous raids were made at
various points along the frontiers. In some
quarters it was feared that these raids were
the prelude to an early invasion. They
were, as a matter of fact, designed to
harass the Russians and keep them engaged
while the Germans completed the
mobilisation of the forces which were to
defend Eastern Prussia and, if possible,
invade Poland during the absence of the first
line troops in the western theatre of war.
These new forces were chiefly composed
of the Landwehr, and comprised about
twenty divisions of 20,000 men each,
with thirty-one cavalry regiments and six
batteries of artillery. This army, under
the command of General von Hindenburg,
was mobilised along a line about thirty
miles from the frontier. Its right flank
was protected by the marshes around Arys,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
while its left rested on Insterburg. Naturally
it took some days to collect this army and
prepare it for attack, and it was not until
nearly the middle of August that the Germans
were in a position to contemplate any
serious advance.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Russians, who were
collecting considerable forces under General
Rennenkampf, were able to throw back the
cavalry which was harassing them, and to
make a tentative advance over the Prussian
frontier. On August 5th they entered
Eydtkuhnen without opposition, and proceeded
to advance towards the main German
army. It was not until they reached Stalluponen
that they encountered serious opposition.
A sharp action resulted in the
Germans being turned out of the town,
leaving 200 dead and some machine guns.</p>

<p>This advance on the part of Russia was
hailed in the west as a definite invasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
with the object of sweeping across Prussia
to Berlin. It was nothing of the sort.
Russia was only advancing because the
Germans had not yet collected their full
forces. Indeed, Russia was by no means
ready, and she carefully refrained from
pressing too far forward, pending the
completion of her own preparations. After
the affair of Stalluponen there was obviously
the temptation to push forward. But this
would have brought the attacking force
dangerously near the main German army
and dangerously distant from Russian support.
The advance, therefore, ceased until
stronger forces could be brought forward.
The German preparations, too, were progressing,
and they were able to deliver
vigorous attacks on the small invading force.
Numerous attempts were made to recapture
both Stalluponen and Eydtkuhnen, but all
were beaten back. Then, after an interval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of about a week, the main Russian army,
under General Rennenkampf pushed forward,
and the advance into Eastern Prussia
may be said to have definitely begun.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Germans had been active
further to the south. The provinces of
Kalish and Kelche in Russian Poland were
invaded. The invading forces were not in
any great strength, but the Russians did
not attempt to offer any serious opposition
to the advance, contenting themselves
with pursuing the same tactics as those
adopted by the Germans in Eastern Prussia.
The Germans, for their part, were in no
mind to hurry, and were content to advance
slowly and prepare for the coming shock
between the main armies. They established
themselves firmly along a line extending
from Sieradz in the north, through
Radomsk towards Kelche.</p>

<p>In the preliminary operations between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Russia and Germany, therefore, neither
side could claim any great advantage. The
Russians obtained a footing in Eastern
Prussia, and the Germans penetrated into
Russian Poland. As events turned out,
however, the latter was the more permanent
advantage.</p>

<p>The operations between Russia and
Austria were more decisive. The invasion
of Russian Poland by the Austrians was a
very half-hearted affair. The mutinous
spirit of the troops and the wholly unexpected
success of the attack by the Serbians
and Montenegrins on Bosnia and Herzegovina
paralysed the Austrian advance.
Nevertheless, some progress was made in
Poland, thanks more to lack of opposition
than to any display of military virtues.
Forces from Cracow proceeded northward
over the frontier, and joined the Germans
between Kelche and Radomsk. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
advance was described in Berlin and Vienna
as a triumphant march on Warsaw, but it
was not anything so serious. Warsaw was
never in the slightest danger. However, it
was certainly an advance.</p>

<p>The Russian invasion of Galicia, on the
other hand, was of definite significance.
As early as August 8th a Russian army
advanced from Rovno, crossed the Styr,
and obtained a footing across the frontier.
On the 10th the Austrians had their first
experience of the Cossacks. Two regiments
of infantry, supported by a regiment of
cavalry, occupied a position near Brody.
They were attacked by a company of Cossacks,
and in the course of a few minutes
were in the wildest flight, leaving ample
evidence of the prowess of the Cossacks.</p>

<p>On the 12th the Russians gained an important
success by capturing Sokal, which
lies on the River Bug, just across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
frontier. The town is an important railway
centre, and its possession was a matter
of vital interest to Austria. A determined
advance towards Vladimir Volynski was a
definite part of the Austrian programme.
If successful, the move would have had
far-reaching effects, for it would have
broken the railway between Rovno and
Warsaw, and so seriously impeded the completion
of the Russian mobilisation and
render communication between her central
and southern armies very difficult. For
this advance Sokal was the only possible
base of operations. The Austrians, therefore,
defended the town to the utmost of
their power. The passage of the Bug was
fiercely contended, but after some hours of
furious fighting, during which both sides
lost heavily, the Russians managed to capture
the bridge. This practically settled
the engagement. The town was unfortified,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and at the mercy of the attacking force. The
Austrians, with the dreaded Cossacks in
pursuit, were soon in headlong flight out of
the town. The destruction of the railway
station and bridge rendered the Austrian
advance in this direction impossible for
some considerable time.</p>

<p>When, therefore, on August 17th, a
general advance was ordered, Russia had
every reason to be satisfied with the state
of affairs. True, the enemy had established
themselves in Poland, but this was more
than balanced by the advances into Eastern
Prussia and Galicia. Russia indeed had
achieved more than she had reckoned on.
During this preliminary phase she had fully
expected that Poland would be invaded.
She had also expected that her right and
left flanks would have been more or less
seriously threatened by forces from Eastern
Prussia and Galicia during the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
difficult process of mobilisation. The forces
at Kovno and Rovno were sent to deal with
that menace, and to hold it in check until
the main armies were ready. They not
only achieved that object, but carried the
attack into the enemies’ countries.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Advance into Eastern Prussia</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Russians must be somewhat of a disappointment
to many experts, professional
and amateur, whose supreme ignorance
of the conditions obtaining in the eastern
theatre of the war was only equalled by
their sublime confidence in the ability of a
steamroller to push forward, full steam
ahead, over all obstacles and against all
opposition. When towards the middle of
August the news came that Russia was
ready for serious business, it was confidently
predicted that the end was in
sight. It was only a matter of 180 miles
from the Russian frontier to Berlin, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Germans had only Landwehr and Landsturm
forces, contemptible third-rate fighting
material, to defend her territories,
and Austria was too busy shooting her
own mutinous soldiers to be a menace to
anybody. Obviously then, said the strategists,
it could only be a matter of days
before the tramp of the Russian legions
would be heard perilously close to Berlin,
the Kaiser would have to withdraw his
forces from the west to meet the danger
in the east, the allies would overthrow
his weakened armies and hurl them back
against the oncoming Russian hordes.
Armageddon looked to be in danger of
degenerating into a race to Berlin.</p>

<p>The expected has not happened. In
spite of many rumours it may be taken as
certain that the Germans have not to any
great extent reduced their forces in the west.
The fierceness of the fighting there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
sufficient proof of this. And instead of being
on the very threshold of Berlin, the main
Russian armies are still 400 miles away.</p>

<p>It is Russia’s due that this failure to
come up to expectation should be explained.</p>

<p>It is quite true that from the most
westerly point on the frontier of Russian
Poland to Berlin is only a matter of 180
miles. A glance at the map, however,
will show that Poland is more or less a
wedge driven into German territory. The
average distance from the frontier to Berlin
is much more than 180 miles. Nevertheless,
Russia might have made a dash on
Berlin along the route indicated. There
would be every likelihood, too, of the
dash proving successful. The country
would be favourable for a quick advance.
The communications are good&mdash;well-made
roads and direct railway connection with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the Russian base at Warsaw. The River
Oder would be the only natural obstacle,
and the fortress of Posen the only artificial
one. And the country being open, it
would be easier to attack than to defend.</p>

<p>But apart from the fact that the capture
of Berlin would no more crush Germany
than the occupation of Brussels has crushed
Belgium, such an advance would be doomed
to disaster. The invading army might
reach Berlin itself, but sooner or later, it
would find itself cut off from its supplies.
It would necessarily have left behind it
large forces of German troops in Eastern
Prussia, and equally strong Austrian armies
in Galicia. It could only be a matter of time
before Russia would meet with a greater and
more disastrous Sedan. Such a move would
be a terrible blunder of which no general in
his senses would be guilty.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
troops in East Prussia were only Landwehr
reserves and that the <i>moral</i> of the Austrians
was so bad that it would have been possible
for Russians to leave sufficient forces to
hold both armies in check. In the first
place it has been amply proved, again and
again during the present war that the
partially trained reserves when capably led,
and in sufficiently large numbers, can hold
their own with first line troops. In the
second place, although the Slav regiments
were mutinous, Austria had quite two million
Teutons and Magyars in her army. These
men were unquestionably loyal and quite
capable of giving a good account of themselves.</p>

<p>Before, therefore, they could set off
on that 180 mile journey, it was necessary
for the Russians to remove all sources of
danger to their rear. The Germans must
be turned out of Eastern Prussia or safely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
held in their own territories, and the
Austrians swept from Galicia.</p>

<p>The task of capturing Eastern Prussia
is one of unusual difficulty. It is a
region which it is very much easier to defend
than to attack. The greater part of it is
covered with marshes, lakes and forests,
most difficult country for an army to traverse.
The means of communication are
poor, the roads&mdash;a most important consideration
in connection with the movement
of the heavy artillery necessary for a
successful invasion&mdash;are in many instances
little better than tracks. Moreover, it is
strongly fortified. Königsberg is a first-class
modern fortress, whilst those on the
line of the Vistula at Thorn, Graudenz and
Dantzig are even more powerful. Königsberg
and Dantzig, it should also be noted,
have the advantage of being ports as well
as fortified towns. In other words, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
could be used for large supplies of men and
material. An invading army, therefore,
could not content itself with merely masking
the fortresses unless it was supported
by a navy enjoying the command of the
sea. The Russian fleet was practically a
prisoner in the Gulf of Finland. The
German navy was in complete command
of the Baltic, and, therefore, to be safe,
the invading army would have to storm the
fortresses and gain possession of the ports.</p>

<p>The German War Staff, of course, knew
perfectly well how difficult was Russia’s
task of subduing Eastern Prussia. Hence
it was not likely that they were in any way
panic stricken over Russia’s advance, at
least in that direction. Before that advance
could become dangerous the whole
of Eastern Prussia would have to be in
Russian hands and the passage of the
Vistula forced. There was every prospect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of Russia being busily engaged for weeks
to come.</p>

<p>And it must not be forgotten that the
mobilisation was not complete at the time
that the general advance was ordered.
Thousands of troops cannot be gathered
from the farthest confines of Siberia and
transported across Asia and half-way across
Europe. Only the first phase was completed.
Time was still necessary before
Russia could put her full strength in the
field. The army under General Rennenkampf
which invaded Prussia did not
comprise the million men with which it
was credited. It is doubtful whether he
had half-a-million men with him. Certainly
he had no more during the early
stages of the campaign. Besides invading
Prussia, Russia had to invade Galicia,
drive back the forces invading Poland and
generally guard a frontier about seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
times as long as that between Germany
and France. Another reason why General
Rennenkampf’s army was not so large as
it was popularly supposed to be was the
fact that the Grand Duke Nicholas, the
Commander-in-Chief, did not, for reasons
that will be subsequently examined, regard
the invasion of Eastern Prussia as of such
paramount importance as the invasion of
Galicia.</p>

<p>In dealing with this campaign, therefore,
its secondary importance should not for a
moment be forgotten. Both victory and
defeat must be tempered with the knowledge
that neither will have the far-reaching
effect hoped for or feared. Of course, that
is not to say that the Russians did not
care what happened in Prussia. If it should
prove that the defending German forces
were weaker than was believed, if it were
possible to overcome all transport difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
if Rennenkampf should march from
victory to victory, driving the Germans
back over the line of the Vistula, so much
the better. But such an accomplishment
would be a feat of arms worthy of Napoleon
himself. Rennenkampf was known to be
a remarkably clever general and great
things were expected of him&mdash;otherwise
he would not have been chosen for the
most difficult command&mdash;but there was no
reason to credit him with superhuman
genius.</p>

<p>Popular enthusiasm, however, both in
Russia and the West, knowing nothing
of circumstances and conditions, and full of
implicit faith in Russian prowess, immediately
jumped to the conclusion that
Rennenkampf was the man who was
destined to alter the whole trend of the
war. The campaign, therefore, assumed
a rather exaggerated importance which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
was not remedied until actual events had
their inevitable sobering influence.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the general advance,
the Russians found themselves firmly established
in the neighbourhood of Stalluponen.
Before them lay a strong German army,
under General von Hindenburg. The advantage
in numbers was with the Germans,
who were in the proportion of roughly
three to two. On the other hand they
were composed to a very large extent of
reserves. The smaller Russian army was
composed of fully trained first line troops.
The coming operations, therefore, were a
test of the comparative values of numbers
and training. Sheer numbers supported
by perfect discipline, such as that which
obtains in the German army, can accomplish
much in modern warfare. The
advance of the Germans in the western
theatre of war had already proved as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
much. And in these days when the personal
factor in warfare, at least so far as
the rank and file is concerned, has been
practically eliminated, and the tendency
is to rely for victory more and more on
artillery and material superiority rather
than on personal qualities, the age, training
and fitness of the troops is of less importance
than in the old days when battles consisted
of downright fighting. The finest troops
in the world are helpless when exposed to
an efficient artillery attack. In point of
artillery the two armies in Eastern Prussia
were about evenly matched, the superiority,
if any, being on the side of the Germans.
Consequently, it will be realised that the
Russians were faced with a difficult task.</p>

<p>The advance, which after the taking of
Stalluponen had temporarily ceased, was
resumed with vigour. The region to the
north towards Tilsit was cleared of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
enemy. Cavalry patrols scoured the country
and there were innumerable minor
engagements. In all of these the Russians
were successful and the Germans were
forced to withdraw their outposts towards
the line Stillen, Gumbinnen and Goldap.
The only engagement of any importance
occurred some miles to the north of Stalluponen.
Here a strong Russian force fell
on a German army corps, which was occupying
a rather advanced position. The
fighting continued for practically a whole
day, and in spite of fierce Russian attacks,
the Germans held their ground. Towards
the evening, however, their left flank was
turned and soon they were in full retreat
towards Gumbinnen. The Russians captured
some hundreds of prisoners besides
eight field guns, twelve cannons and three
machine guns.</p>

<p>Inspired by this success the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
pushed forward. But the Germans contested
every foot of ground. The Russian
movement, too, was considerably hampered
by the excellence of the German means of
obtaining information. Their airmen were
everywhere in evidence, and displayed the
greatest courage and daring in face of the
Russian aeroplanes, which were mostly of
the heavy Sikorski type. The latter, excellent
machines though they are, were outmatched
in point of speed by the German
Taube machines, and were therefore unable
to deal effectively with the menace from
the air. The country, too, was infested
with spies. Every movement of the
Russians was signalled to the defending
forces.</p>

<p>On one occasion a large force of Cossacks
was sent to carry out a surprise attack on a
German force occupying a village to the
south of Stalluponen. As they moved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
forward, it was noticed that a haystack
had caught alight. A tramp and a pipe
were the explanation. The owner was
greatly upset at his loss and made every
effort to save his property. He worked
with desperate energy, throwing bucket after
bucket of water on the flames. The only
result, however, was that a dense column
of black smoke rose from the stack. The
Cossacks pushed on. A couple of miles
from the village they had to pass through
wooded country. Suddenly a storm of
lead swept through them. They had been
ambushed. In close formation, and scarcely
able to turn, they were mowed down
by the score. When the few survivors
returned to their headquarters the haystack
was still smouldering, but the owner had
disappeared. It was found subsequently
that the “water” which he had so vigorously
thrown on the flames was a chemical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
solution which had caused the dense clouds
of smoke, serving to warn the Germans of
the coming attack.</p>

<p>The advance, however, continued in spite
of all the courage and cunning displayed by
the Germans. The Russian cavalry in
particular distinguished itself by its dash
and bravery. The German advance guards
and outposts were overwhelmed by the
fury of its attack. Thanks to its superb,
almost reckless, bravery and its bewildering
mobility, the way was cleared for the
main army, so that on the 19th it found
itself facing a strong German army defending
Gumbinnen.</p>

<p>In the meantime a Russian force had
advanced in a north-westerly direction
from Bialestock and had crossed the frontier
at Prostken. Moving rapidly, it captured
Lyck after a sharp engagement, and pushed
on towards Lotzen. Here their progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
was barred by a German army corps holding
a strong position. Some desperate fighting
ensued, but the Russians forced their
way into the town and the Germans retreated
northward along the lakes towards
their main army at Gumbinnen.</p>

<p>Obviously the time had now come for a
decisive engagement. Any further retreat
on the part of the Germans would entail
the abandonment of Insterburg, a most
important railway junction, the possession
of which was the key to the whole of the
country lying east of Königsberg and
Allenstein. The Germans, faced by the
main Russian army on the south-east
towards Goldap, and with its right flank
threatened by the victorious force marching
on from Lotzen, prepared for a determined
resistance.</p>

<p>As early as the 17th the civilian inhabitants
had been ordered to leave the town,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
at the same time reinforcements were
brought up from the west and north so
that the strength of the defending army
amounted to about 200,000 men. On the
morning of the 20th, the Russian right
rested on the village of Pilkallen, its left
on Goldap. Everything was in readiness
for a determined onslaught. At dawn the
battle began with a terrific artillery duel.
Soon the shells of the heavy German guns
were causing havoc in the Russian lines,
but after a time the Russian artillery began
to manifest a superiority, and some of the
enemy’s guns were silenced. The Russian
infantry then moved forward to the attack,
and some of the most desperate fighting
of the war took place.</p>

<p>The Russians were subjected to a merciless
fire from machine and field guns. On
all sides men were falling. But they never
wavered for an instant. On and on they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
pressed until they reached the German
trenches. There the bayonets got to work
and soon the defenders were forced to give
ground. But they were by no means
defeated. Time after time they hurled
themselves forward in the most desperate
counter attacks, but the Russians succeeded
in holding their own.</p>

<p>It was during this period of the engagement
that one of the most significant
events&mdash;so far as Russia is concerned&mdash;of
the whole war occurred. A Russian battalion
was in the midst of a veritable inferno.
The Germans were determined to hold an
important position at all costs. The
Russians were equally determined to capture
it. On both sides the carnage had
been terrible. At last, with a desperate
rush, the Russians succeeded in getting to
grips with the Germans. Indescribable
hand-to-hand fighting ensued. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
midst of the mêlée a German bayoneted
the Russian Standard-bearer and seized the
flag. Emboldened by this emblem of
victory the Germans renewed their efforts
and dashed to the assistance of their comrade.
But before they could reach him a
young Russian had sprung forward, killed
him and recaptured the flag. With a howl
of disappointment the Germans attacked
him. For a moment he seemed to be
doomed. Germans, were all round him
struggling for the possession of the flag.
Then there came a deep-throated roar, a
sudden rush, and the Germans were hurled
back. The Russians had captured the
position and saved their flag.</p>

<p>The youth who had held it against such
odds was afterwards discovered severely
wounded. He proved to be a young Jewish
medical student from Vilna, named Osnas.
He was at once hailed on all sides as a hero,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
and on being invalided back to Petrograd
the Commander himself gave orders that
every care was to be taken to save the life
of “Osnas the hero.” Subsequently he
received the military cross of St. George,
the Russian V.C., from the hands of the
Tzar himself.</p>

<p>The significance of the incident does not
lie in the bravery of Osnas, but in the fact
that he was a Jew. His action, which has
made him a popular hero throughout the
Russian Empire, has done more to improve
the position of the Jews than any event in
the whole course of their history in Russia.
It has made the nation realise that a Jew
can be a worthy son of Russia.</p>

<p>While these fierce attacks and counter-attacks
were taking place at the centre
and on the Russian left, determined
attempts were made to envelop the
right flank resting on Pilkallen. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
successful resistance of this movement was
chiefly due to the brilliant work of the
Russian cavalry.</p>

<p>The Germans occupied a strong position
towards the north-west, from which their
artillery was able to pour a murderous fire
into the Russian ranks. At length it
became obvious that unless the guns were
silenced the Russians would have to retreat.
The Horse Guards were ordered to take the
guns. The first squadron charged straight
at the battery. There was an ominous
silence. The distance grew less and less.
Then at point blank range the gunners
fired. The squadron was practically annihilated.
The second squadron then
charged. It seemed as if it were doomed
to a like fate, but at the critical moment the
third squadron took the battery on the
flank. In a few minutes every gunner was
either sabred or fleeing for safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
For fourteen hours the battle raged until
darkness caused a cessation of hostilities.
The Russians were, on the whole, satisfied
with the results of the day’s work. They
had suffered heavy losses, but the enemy
had suffered more. They had made distinct
progress in the centre, had captured
thirty guns and large numbers of prisoners.</p>

<p>The engagement on the 21st opened sensationally.
In the early hours of the morning
a strong force of Cossack cavalry moved
northwards and managed to envelop the
German left flank. Dawn was the signal
for a combined movement. The Germans
found themselves vigorously attacked in
the centre and left. For a time they held
their ground, but their position soon became
untenable. There was no holding the
Russian attack. A regiment of Cossacks,
finding the ground unsuitable for cavalry
operations, dismounted and hurled themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
forward with all their reckless ferocity.
Gradually the Russians pressed forward
until they were attacking the enemy on
three sides. The result was then inevitable.
Von Hindenburg had the choice of flight or
of allowing his army to be surrounded.
He decided to retreat. Soon retreat degenerated
into rout, and vast quantities of
stores and ammunition, besides thousands
of prisoners fell into the hands of the
Russians.</p>

<p>The battle of Gumbinnen was the first
decisive engagement of the war. Its immediate
result was to make Russia master
of the whole of Prussia east of the line
from Königsberg to Allenstein. There was
no position which afforded von Hindenburg
any hope of successful resistance even if he
were able to collect his routed troops.
Insterburg, the main point in the network
of German strategic railways, fell into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Russian hands on the evening after the
battle and ensured for Rennenkampf ample
supplies. Tilsit was isolated, and its capture
was a matter of convenience. The
whole region of the Mauer lakes was at the
mercy of the Russians.</p>

<p>The moral advantages were as great as
the material. Von Hindenburg’s army had
been badly beaten, and would never be able
to face the Russians again with the same
confidence. Moreover, the rout of the
Germans and the reputation of the pursuing
Cossacks caused a panic throughout the
province. From every village and town
the inhabitants began to fly in terror, some
towards Danzig, others towards Graudenz
in the hope of reaching Berlin. Soon Danzig
was in a state of chaos. Two hundred and
fifty thousand refugees poured in with the
most exaggerated stories of the prowess
of the Russians. Commerce was at a stand-still;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the prices of provisions rose daily. Soon
there was rioting in the streets. There was
no accommodation for the refugees, most
of whom were penniless, and who were
almost as numerous as the ordinary inhabitants
of the town. It was not until
the sternest measures had been taken by
the military authorities that the panic
subsided and some show of order was
restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russians were following
up their victory with a vigorous pursuit.
Von Hindenburg’s army divided into two,
one portion retreating through Tapiau to
Königsberg, the other pressing in a south-westerly
direction towards Allenstein, and
the fortresses of Thorn and Graudenz. The
former portion safely reached its destination,
which was invested by the Russians
on the 25th. On the same day Tilsit was
formally occupied. Meanwhile the main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Russian army, meeting with practically no
resistance, pushed on along the line of the
railway, occupying Angerberg and Korschen.
By this time, however, heavy German reinforcements
had come up, and the advance
began to be contested with increasing determination.
For three days there was vigorous
fighting in the neighbourhood of Allenstein.
Then, after inflicting heavy losses on the
Germans, Rennenkampf entered the town
and again forced von Hindenburg to retreat.
The action, however, was not a
decisive battle comparable with Gumbinnen,
and the Russian advance became
slow. Further fierce fighting, most of which
resulted satisfactorily to the Russians, took
place further to the south around Soldau
and Nesdenberg.</p>

<p>The Russians, after a remarkably quick
advance through very difficult country,
had now come within hail of the line of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Vistula. The line was protected by three
first-class fortresses covered by at least four
army corps in addition to the armies which
had been driven back by the Russians.
It was the critical moment of the campaign.
With their heavy numerical superiority
and strongly fortified position, the Germans
would be sure to make a more determined
resistance, and in greater force than any
which the Russians had yet had to meet.
In attacking the line Rennenkampf would
be handicapped by a lack of heavy siege
artillery, and by the numerical inferiority
of his forces. On the other hand his troops
comprised some of the finest fighting
material in the world, they were flushed
with victory and could be relied upon to
make a tremendous effort to win the
greatest triumph of all. If they could
drive the Germans over the Vistula and
bring up sufficiently large forces to invest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Thorn, Graudenz and Danzig, the northern
route to Berlin would be open to them as
far as the Oder. The beginning of the end
would indeed have arrived.</p>

<p>The Russians accordingly pushed forward.
But they did not advance much
further on the road to the Vistula. An
immense German army, heavily supported
by artillery, including numbers of the heavy
siege guns which had already proved themselves
to be the Kaiser’s most potent
weapons, awaited the Russians in a strong
position in the neighbourhood of Osterode,
midway between Allenstein and Graudenz.</p>

<p>Von Hindenburg now proved himself to
be a leader of remarkable skill and resource
and he performed as brilliant a feat of
generalship as the war has yet produced.
Only a year before he had taken part in
the manœuvres in East Prussia, and was
acquainted with every inch of the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
It was even stated that he had already
solved the exact military problem with
which he was now faced, and in the same
locality. In addition he enjoyed the
advantage of outnumbering the Russians
by at least two to one.</p>

<p>These factors practically decided the
battle. The district around Allenstein and
Osterode is of the worst possible description
for an invading force. It is a mass of lakes,
swamps and forests, and an intimate knowledge
of the locality is essential for the
success of any military operations there.
There are almost insuperable difficulties in
the way of transport alone.</p>

<p>Utilising his advantages to the full,
von Hindenburg lured the Russians towards
Tannenberg to the south-east of
Osterode. The Russians, realising that a
successful offensive was their only chance,
blundered forward. They pressed on until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
they found themselves in a position where
their flanks rested on more or less solid
ground, but their centre was backed by a
vast swamp. Then von Hindenburg struck
his blow. An immense force was hurled
against the Russian right. A desperate
encounter followed, but sheer weight of
numbers gave victory to the Germans.
The Russians were forced back on to the
swamps. A similar attack on the Russian
left was equally successful.</p>

<p>What followed was not a battle; it
was one of the most hideous slaughters
history has known. The Russians were
unable to manœuvre on the swampy
ground; the Germans, on the other hand,
were in possession of the solid higher ground
and free to move at will. From three sides
they poured a murderous fire into the
helpless Russians, forcing them deeper and
deeper into the swamps. Guns sank in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the mud, horses were unable to move, men
stood up to their waists in the deadly slime.
The carnage continued until nightfall, when
Rennenkampf managed to escape with a
remnant of his army, leaving Generals
Samsonov, Martos and Pestitsch among
the thousands of slain.</p>

<p>Thus von Hindenburg won the battle of
Osterode and obtained ample revenge for
his defeat at Gumbinnen.</p>

<p>The battle caused a complete reversal
of the campaign. The route to Berlin via
the north was not only barred, but the
Russian advance was turned into a retreat.
Hopelessly outnumbered, Rennenkampf was
forced back on Allenstein. Every foot of
the way was contested, but bit by bit he
had to give up the results of his victorious
move forward. Allenstein and Intersburg
were in turn evacuated before the merciless
pressure of the advancing Germans. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
troops investing Königsberg were recalled.
It was not until the frontiers were almost
reached and strong reinforcements came up
from Kovno and Grodno that the German
advance was checked and finally held.</p>

<p>In spite of official attempts at secrecy,
the news soon spread that the invasion of
Germany upon which Russia’s Allies had
placed such high hopes had ended in what
appeared to be complete failure. Berlin
was as far off as ever, and the Germans
were at the very gates of Paris. Something
had gone seriously wrong with the steam
roller on which so much had depended!</p>

<p>The strategists were wrong in the blame
they heaped on Rennenkampf’s head because
of his failure. As a matter of fact,
his chief fault was that he had played his
part too well. He had never been expected
to push forward so far as Osterode. His
“advance” was intended simply to attract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
German attention and to prevent Germany
from sending reinforcements to the Austrian
army. In attaining this object he succeeded
admirably. After the battle of
Gumbinnen the Germans poured regiment
after regiment of Landwehr and Landsturm
troops into Eastern Prussia, which otherwise
would have gone to the aid of the
Austrians. Rennenkampf’s unexpected success
took him too far forward. His advance
was so rapid that it was difficult to bring up
reinforcements. Osterode and its heavy
losses was the penalty he paid for success.</p>

<p>The only really unfortunate result of
his efforts was that he attracted such strong
forces into Prussia that the Russians will
have great difficulty in dislodging them.
They are, however, strong enough to keep
them confined to their own territories, and
so have little to fear from that direction.</p>

<p>Besides, there are other ways to Berlin.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Advance into Galicia</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>It has already been pointed out that Russia
could not advance directly on Berlin and
thus expose herself to the danger of being
cut off and annihilated by German armies
from East Prussia and Austrians from
Galicia. A march on Posen would more
likely than not have resulted in another and
more stupendous Sedan. In the previous
chapter it was shown that, for various
reasons, the Russian General Staff decided
not to threaten Berlin by the northern
route through Prussia. The nature of the
country was unfavourable for any such
movement; it was strongly fortified and
capably defended. Moreover, the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
winter was approaching had to be taken into
account. Those who have had the misfortune
to spend the winter months at
Königsberg or other towns in Eastern
Prussia will agree with the Russian Staff
that the conditions during that period
of the year do not favour military or
any other operations. And it was essential
that Russia should maintain a vigorous
offensive, if only to keep faith with her
allies.</p>

<p>That there was another route to Berlin,
and one which possessed many obvious
advantages, was overlooked by most of the
strategists. The route in question lies along
the banks of the Oder, through Silesia and
Saxony. If Russia could crush the military
power of Austria in Galicia and drive
the remnants of her armies across the
Carpathians, either pursuing them to Buda-Pesth
and Vienna or confining them to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Hungarian plains, she would be free to
advance upon Breslau and Berlin.</p>

<p>There are many advantages possessed by
this route. In the first place, it would be
safe, assuming that Austria were thoroughly
broken beforehand. The country is open and
well provided with railways, excellent roads,
and other means of communication; it contains
only one fortress of any strength&mdash;Neisse&mdash;which
could be easily masked, and
is generally favourable to a rapid advance.
An additional advantage is that Silesia is
a busy mining and industrial province, with
a population of nearly 6,000,000. The
invading army would be preceded by armies
of panic-stricken fugitives, who would impede
any defensive measures and strike
terror in Berlin long before the menace of
the invaders became serious.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, in view of
(1) that the chief Russian armies are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
engaged in Galicia and Poland, and (2) that
no serious attempt has been made either to
follow up General Rennenkampf’s remarkable
advance in East Prussia or to retrieve
the ground lost as a result of the defeat
at Osterode, that an advance on the lines
suggested through Galicia and Silesia is the
main feature of the Russian strategy. It
is the simplest, safest and most effective
route by which Germany could be invaded.
It is the one route an advance along which,
supported by a vigorous offensive from
Poland, would have an immediate effect
on the war in the west. When once the
Russians begin to march on Breslau, it will
be only a matter of weeks before they reach
Berlin, unless the Germans detach very
strong forces from their western army
and hurry them across to defend the
capital.</p>

<p>But first of all, Austria must be smashed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and Galicia and Poland swept clear of the
enemy.</p>

<p>At the end of the preliminary phase of
the campaign, the Russians had already
gained a footing in Galicia in the neighbourhood
of the River Styr, whilst the
Austrians had advanced northwards from
Cracow and established themselves in
Poland. This Austrian army, after being
heavily reinforced, so that it amounted to
about 500,000 men, began to march northward
towards Warsaw. It was then still
further reinforced by a German army which
had advanced from Posen, and invaded the
Polish province of Kalisch. In Poland,
therefore, there was a very considerable
army which seriously threatened Lublin
and Warsaw, and would require heavy and
probably extended operations before it
could be forced back.</p>

<p>A second Austrian army, smaller than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the first, was in Galicia, with Lemberg for
its base.</p>

<p>The operations against these two armies
constitute the real “Russian Advance,” the
movement intended to prepare for the crushing
of Austria and a march on Berlin. That
it would be slow was obvious. Opposing it
were, at the time under review, about
1,500,000 troops, with two first-class fortresses
in Cracow and Przemysl and a
hardly less strong position in Lemberg.
The question remained, how would Russia
act? Would she concentrate her attention
on driving the first Austrian army on to
Galicia, or would she deliver her main
attack on the second army, and invade
Galicia from the east, trusting on her
success and consequent menace to the
communications of the first army to force
that army back on to its base? The former
course would be the safer, for the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Austro-German army was a more formidable
force than the second. The latter
course, if the more hazardous, had the
merit of speed. The Grand Duke Nicholas
decided to adopt this plan, much to the
surprise of the Austrians. An army was
sent from Warsaw to operate against the
Austro-German army in Poland, but the
main army, under General Russki, had
Kiev for base, and immediate preparations
began for a vigorous and sweeping movement
through Galicia.</p>

<p>It was, however, essential for the success
of the plan that the Austro-German army
should be held in check until the menace
to its rear was strong enough to force it
back. If it were to capture Lublin or
seriously threaten Warsaw, the whole
scheme would be in danger of collapse.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that while
these operations were in progress Austria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
was fighting on her southern frontier against
Serbia and Montenegro. The war in the
south naturally affected to some extent
the war in the north. A series of victories
in the south would undoubtedly have
provided the Austrians in the north with
the moral tonic they so sadly needed. As
it happened, however, the war in the south
was a complete failure. Seven attempts
were made to capture Belgrade, an utterly
defenceless town, but each was repulsed.
The invasion of Serbia ended in the rout of
Shabatz. The Austrians thereupon abandoned
their operations against Serbia, and
threw all their forces into the northern war.
Whatever advantage was gained by this
increase in numbers was for the time being
more than counterbalanced by the shattered
<i>moral</i> of the additional troops. Mutiny
had already done much to destroy the spirit
of the troops. The companionship of men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
who had been routed by the despised
Serbians was not calculated to improve
matters. However, Austria needed every
man in the north to defend her reputation
as a first-class military power.</p>

<p>Her plan of campaign amounted to an
attempt to force the reversal of the Russian
plan. The main army was to carry out a
vigorous invasion of Poland in two directions,
towards Lublin on the north-east
and towards Lodz on the north. The
latter movement would receive help from
the Germans operating in the province of
Kalisch. The success of these movements
would render a determined invasion of
Galicia from the east impossible. Russia
would have to change her plan and concentrate
her efforts on defeating the invading
Austrians and driving them back across the
frontier. Obviously this would have suited
the German plans admirably, because it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
would have delayed the Russian advance
indefinitely, and so relieve the dangerous
position resulting from the unexpected
success of the Russian mobilisation and the
equally unexpected failure of the attempt
to crush France in the course of a few weeks.
Viewing the war as a whole, therefore, the
main object of both sides was to gain time.
The Allies wanted to delay the German
advance until the pressure of Russia on the
east became unbearable. The Austrian
object was to hold Russia in check and
so enable Germany to maintain an undiminished
army in the west. The issue of
the whole war now depended on the efforts
of Austria, for even if the Allies in the west
were able, as the result of a vigorous offensive,
to force the Germans out of France and
Belgium, it was extremely doubtful whether
they would be able to invade Germany
itself with anything more than moderate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
success, unless the Germans were forced to
divide their troops more or less equally
between the two frontiers.</p>

<p>The most important operations in the
east, therefore, were the advance of the
main Austrian army on Lublin and the
advance of the Germans through Kalisch.
Until these were positively checked the
projected Russian advance could not be
pushed forward. But, once checked, a successful
Russian advance would cause the
retirement or downfall of these invaders of
Poland unless they were heavily reinforced.</p>

<p>The campaign opened with a serious
defeat for Russia. The Austrian army
crossed the frontier and established contact
with the defending forces in the neighbourhood
of Krasnik, a little town some fifteen
miles across the border. Details of the
engagement are very few. Officially, the
Russians ignored it, being wholly taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
up with the telling the world about their
successes in Prussia. What appears to
have happened was that the Russians did
not expect the enemy to throw forward
such strong forces, and were taken by
surprise. Heavily superior in point of
numbers and well supported by artillery,
the Austrians, while unable to break the
Russian centre, seem to have successfully
carried out a flanking movement. The
Russians fought gamely, and inflicted heavy
losses on the enemy, but their defeat was
inevitable. The Austrians claimed to have
captured some thousands of prisoners and
much artillery. In view of the results of
the battle, it is quite possible that their
claims were not exaggerated.</p>

<p>The serious results of this engagement
were at once apparent. The heaviness
of the defeat made it impossible for the
Russians to make a determined resistance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
against the Austrian advance for some time.
The Austrians overran Kelche and pressed
forward on Lublin.</p>

<p>In the course of this advance the Austrians
made brave attempts to imitate
their German allies. The occupation of
Kamenetz Podolski was a good example
of their efforts to play the Hun. The town
was captured after a sharp engagement, in
the course of which the Austrian commander
had the misfortune to be slightly
wounded. His first act was to demand
200,000 roubles, 200 horsed carts, 800 poods
of bread and 60 oxen. Unless this levy
were forthcoming by eight o’clock the
next morning, the mayor was to be hanged
and the town sacked. At the best of
times this would have been an almost impossible
demand on the resources of Kamenetz,
which is only a small town. On
the approach of the Austrians the Municipal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Treasurer, the bankers and all the wealthy
families had fled, taking their riches with
them. Nobody in the town had so much
as twenty-five roubles in his possession.</p>

<p>The mayor went to inform the general
that it was impossible to fulfil his demands.
The general replied that he would bombard
the town unless the whole levy were
delivered by eight o’clock.</p>

<p>The night was spent by the inhabitants
in the impossible task of trying to raise
the money. Rings, watches and jewellery
of all kinds were collected. The churches
were stripped of their crucifixes and plate.
A valuable collection of old coins, worth at
least 15,000 roubles, left the scales at an
appraisement of seven hundred roubles.
At half-past six in the morning it was
found that not more than five or six
thousand roubles’ worth of gold and silver
had been collected towards the 200,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
demanded. The mayor went to find the
general in the forlorn hope that the latter
would relent. The inhabitants crouched in
their cellars awaiting the dreaded bombardment.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock passed and nothing happened.
The Austrian general had left during
the night, leaving a colonel as governor of
the town. The latter gravely assessed the
levy at 25,000 rubles, returned the crucifixes
and church plate and announced that he
was perfectly satisfied. Then a few hours
later, acting on instructions from Vienna,
he returned the whole levy, to the utter
bewilderment of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>But in spite of these half-hearted attempts
to imitate the Huns, there is no
doubt that for a time the advance of the
Austrian army was a serious matter. General
Bankal, the commander of the force,
drove the Russians from position after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
position in a series of desperate engagements
and it was not until he reached the line
Lublin Kholm that he was definitely
checked, and General Russki was able to
advance in earnest.</p>

<p>The primary cause of General Bankal’s
check was the fact that he found himself face
to face with a strong Russian army, with
the fortress of Ivangorod for a base. This
army was as large as his own, and occupied
an immensely strong position. Bankal,
realising the necessity for maintaining the
offensive, attempted to break through the
Russian centre. After a heavy bombardment
he threw his men forward in close
formation, hoping by force of numbers to
cut a way through. The attempt was
a costly failure. A second and third attempt
fared no better. Then, realising
that his position was hopeless in the face
of such superior forces, Bankal retired,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and soon was in full retreat towards the
south.</p>

<p>In this battle the Russians captured over
5,000 prisoners; whilst the Austrian losses
may be estimated from the fact that over
3,000 of their dead were buried by the
victors.</p>

<p>A secondary cause contributing to General
Bankal’s failure was the lack of German
support from Posen. This was the direct
result of General Rennenkampf’s successful
offensive in Eastern Prussia. In the previous
chapter it was shown how, after the
battle of Gumbinnen and the rapid advance
through Allenstein, the Germans brought up
several army corps to cope with the menace.
They drove back Rennenkampf, but only
at the cost of starving their offensive in
Poland. They were unable to reinforce
both the defensive line of the Vistula and
the armies attacking Poland, unless they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
withdrew a portion of their forces from
the western theatre of war. In spite of
rumours, it may be stated for certain that
no such withdrawal took place. There was
no apparent diminution of German power
in the west, and no reinforcements arrived
in Poland.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, managed to penetrate
as far as Lodz. Their advance was
more due to lack of opposition than to
their own prowess. They were in no great
numbers, and on meeting with a superior
force at Pobianitz, they at once began to
retire without offering any serious resistance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, their advance, insignificant
as it was, is worthy of attention as affording
a comparison between themselves and their
Austrian allies. The latter in the course
of their advance made half-hearted attempts
to win a reputation for savagery, such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the incident at Kamenetz, but on the
whole, their conduct, apart from much
drunkenness and a little looting, was admirable.
The Germans, on the other hand,
fully lived up to the reputation which their
comrades in Belgium had won for themselves.</p>

<p>Their chief exploit was the sacking of
Kalisch. During the German occupation
of the town in the early stages of the
war it was stated that some of the
inhabitants had fired on the soldiers.
General Preusker, the German commander,
at once indulged in the most savage reprisals.
Numerous inhabitants were shot. Some
hundreds of the leading citizens, including
the priests, were seized as hostages and
forced to lie for hours under a broiling sun.
Then suddenly they were marched out of
the town and were told to prepare for
execution. When all was ready, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
wretched prisoners thought that their last
moment had come, the order was countermanded.
The town was then bombarded
by the German artillery. The town hall
and all the chief buildings were ruined,
hundreds of innocent men, women and
children were killed. After witnessing the
destruction of their homes the hostages
were sent as prisoners to Posen.</p>

<p>After this savage display, General Preusker
issued a proclamation to the Poles,
stating that the Kaiser, in return for their
help, would effect the regeneration of the
Polish nation through the influence of
Western culture. Needless to say, the proclamation
met with no response.</p>

<p>The news of this event naturally caused
something of a panic in Western Poland.
At Lodz, for instance, the approach of the
Germans resulted in the town being in
danger of falling into a state of anarchy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
The administrative authorities and the
bankers immediately fled to Warsaw, leaving
the town, which has over 600,000
inhabitants, without protection and without
money. The manufacturers, to their
credit, stayed in the town. The closing of
the banks rendered them for the time being
penniless, and there was danger of riots
from their employés who could not be paid.
The workpeople, however, kept their heads,
and notes were issued by a committee of
leading citizens. Owing to the impossibility
of providing them with food, the
prisoners had to be released. For a time
the fate of the town hung in the balance.
The most trivial event might have inflamed
the workpeople. But, thanks in no small
measure to the fact that all the taverns had
been closed since the beginning of the
mobilisation, calm was gradually restored.
It was almost a relief when the Uhlans at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
last appeared and the thoughts of the
people were distracted by the new menace.</p>

<p>The fighting around Lodz, although temporarily
decisive in that it resulted in the
Germans being driven back over the frontier,
was of only small extent. It was here, however,
that the Cossacks gave the <i>Nemetz</i> a
taste of their qualities. Indeed, the exploit
of Kusma Krutchakov and his companions
was one of the most courageous feats of
the whole war.</p>

<p>He was out on patrol duty with his comrades,
Stchergolkov, Astachov, Ivankov;
and Rvatchov, when they learned that
twenty-seven German horsemen had been
seen in their immediate neighbourhood.
Rvatchov was at once despatched to headquarters
with the news, while the others,
without a moment’s hesitation, set out to
tackle their formidable antagonists, whom
they had seen disappearing behind a hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
After making a detour to escape observation,
the Cossacks divided into pairs, Krutchakov
and Ivankov approaching the Germans
from the rear, the other two from the
front. The leader of the patrol attempted
to inveigle the Germans into a bog, but in
this he was unsuccessful, and the whole
party charged down upon the Cossacks,
who made off on their swift horses.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as the Germans gave
up the chase Krutchakov and his companion,
who had meanwhile been joined by
the other two, followed them and continued
the pursuit for four miles. At last, getting
the enemy in full view in the open country,
they dismounted and opened fire. The
Germans now saw that they had only
four men to deal with, and charged down
upon them at a gallop.</p>

<p>At this the Cossacks mounted and prepared
for a hand-to-hand struggle. As the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Germans approached, their officer was shot
dead. They then closed in upon Ivankov,
who was nearest to them, and attacked
him with their lances.</p>

<p>Before they could get him down, however,
his three companions had sprung in to his
assistance.</p>

<p>Krutchakov swung to one side and
engaged three of the Germans, while his
comrades together got into a close scuffle
with the rest. While one German was trying
to run Astachov through the body, he
himself was pierced by the lance of Stchergolkov
and fell to the ground. Another
German aimed a blow at the head of
Stchergolkov, but was just in time put
down by Ivankov. Three Cossacks then
broke free from the mêlée, Ivankov and
Astachov on one side, pursued by six
Germans, and Stchergolkov on the left,
with three of the enemy on his heels. When
the Germans abandoned the pursuit Ivankov
and Astachov dashed in to the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
of Krutchakov, who, at first beset by
three Germans, now had a dozen round
him.</p>

<p>Against these desperate odds he was
defending himself with coolness and address.
A non-commissioned officer aimed a blow
at his head, but he parried it by swinging up
his carbine. His fingers were slashed, but
not severed, and, dropping the carbine, he
seized the sword and chopped his assailant
down.</p>

<p>When at length help arrived, only five
Germans remained alive. Krutchakov had
received sixteen wounds, and his horse
eleven. Stchergolkov was wounded in two
places, whilst Ivankov escaped with only
one hurt.</p>

<p>The retreat of General Bankal from Lublin
and the driving back of the Germans
from Lodz left General Russki free to move
forward in earnest. The conditions were at
once reversed. Hitherto the successful advance
of General Bankal had caused his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
army to be the most important factor in
the campaign. Now it was only of secondary
importance. The centre of interest
had shifted from Poland to Eastern Galicia.</p>

<p>The advance which was now beginning
was the most important move in the war.
On its success or failure depended the issue
of the whole war. If the Austrians had
been powerful enough to inflict a really
decisive defeat on General Russki, the whole
plan of the Allies would have been thrown
to the ground. Russia, instead of advancing,
would have been forced to act on the
defensive, at least for a time, and her Allies
in the west would have had to abandon all
hope of help until the lost ground could be
retrieved and a fresh advance begun. In
view of the supreme importance of success
and of continued success, every care was
taken to render the advancing army as
invincible as human endeavour could make
it. It represents the flower of the Russian
army, from general to rank and file the Tzar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
could put no finer force into the field. Its
failure would appear to be impossible.</p>

<p>The Russians crossed the frontier at
several points. It is at once apparent that
they would have the advantage of operating
in a friendly country. The Ruthenians
welcomed them as heaven-sent deliverers.
Every man up to the age of fifty had been
summoned to the Austrian armies, but the
women, children and old men who were left
were wild with delight. Processions, headed
by priests, went forward from the villages
to greet the invaders; food and provisions
were gladly given to the troops.</p>

<p>The first action of any magnitude was the
storming of Tarnopol. The Austrians were
in strong force, well entrenched and supported
by artillery. On the morning of
August 23rd the Russian attack began.
For some time an artillery duel raged, and
then the Russian infantry began to advance.
It was received with a hail of bullets from
rifles and machine guns. For four hours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the battle continued, the Russians gradually
pressing forward. Meanwhile their shrapnel
was working havoc in the Austrian trenches.
The defence was showing signs of flagging.
A bayonet charge settled the affair. Unable
to keep back the Russians, the Austrians,
rather than face the bayonets, abandoned
their positions and fled into the town.</p>

<p>But victory was not yet achieved. With
the aid of machine guns mounted on church
towers and prominent buildings, the Austrians
kept up a murderous fire on the
Russians. The order was given to storm the
town, street by street. In fighting of this description,
in which the personal element predominates,
the Cossacks excel. With ruthless
completeness they scoured the town
until there was not an Austrian defender
left. Thousands lay dead in the streets;
the rest were in full flight towards the main
Austrian army defending Lemberg. Several
machine guns, some artillery, and numerous
prisoners fell into the hands of the Russians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
This victory forced back the Austrian
centre, and gave the Russians possession of
the north-eastern corner of Galicia.</p>

<p>The next move was to force back the
Austrian right on to Lemberg, and so
gather the enemy into a suitable position
for a decisive attack and also gain possession
of all the means of communication in
Eastern Galicia. This was effected successfully
by the engagement at Halish, a small
town on the Dniester, on which the Austrian
right rested. Here the victory was in the
main due to the dash and courage of the
Russian cavalry. Early in the engagement
the enemy’s cavalry was put out of action.
In the meantime their artillery had been
playing with good effect on the Russian
infantry. But a cavalry charge on the
flank silenced the guns and the infantry
was able to advance. The Austrians made
a desperate resistance, but were soon forced
into flight.</p>

<p>General Russki, now master of all Galicia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
east of Lemberg, immediately began his
preparations for the attack on what was
now the chief Austrian army, defending
that important town.</p>

<p>Before, however, dealing with the operations
round Lemberg, it is necessary to refer
to the other Austrian army&mdash;that under
General Bankal. After its defeat between
Lublin and Kholm, this army retreated
southwards in the direction of Tomasov.
Any further advance into Poland being out
of the question, General Bankal’s object
was to join forces with the army defending
Lemberg, and so present a greater resistance
to General Russki’s advance. The
troops, which had been occupying the
Polish province of Kielce were also hurriedly
withdrawn towards Lemberg. In order to
prevent this threatened junction of forces,
the Russians made the most determined
efforts to overtake the Austrians. For
some days, however, Bankal, in spite of
heavy losses of artillery and stores, managed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
to elude his pursuers. It was not until he
was within a few miles of Tomasov that he
was forced to give battle. There he was
met by a force sent forward from the right
flank of General Russki’s army. Hastily
entrenching himself, he prepared for a
desperate attempt to throw back the
Russians and force his way to Lemberg.
His position, however, was hopeless. Faced
by a force superior in every way, and
attacked on his left flank by the Russians,
who had been pursuing him, defeat was
inevitable. Nevertheless, the Austrians
fought desperately, and inflicted heavy
losses on the Russians. But their own losses
were terrible. Entire regiments were annihilated.
A shrapnel shell killed Bankal
himself, and several of his staff officers.
Within a few hours the remnants of the
army were pouring over the frontier in full
flight for Przemysl.</p>

<p>In this engagement the Russians captured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
five thousand prisoners and twenty pieces
of artillery.</p>

<p>In the meantime the remaining Austrian
forces in Poland were faring but little
better. At Podgorzo, the troops from Kielce
who were endeavouring to join General
Bankal’s army, and push forward to Lemberg,
were forced to give battle as a result
of a successful turning movement from the
north-east. Here again the fighting was
of a desperate character, but again the issue
was inevitable. Three thousand prisoners
and large quantities of artillery and stores
fell into the hands of the Russians.</p>

<p>Thus ended to all practical intents, the
preliminary Austrian advance into Poland.
It was not until later, when the German
victory at Osterode enabled large forces to
be thrown into Poland, that the enemy were
able to make any definite impression in that
quarter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the movement which it was
supposed to prevent was developing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
strongly. The battle for the possession
of Lemberg had already been fought and
won.</p>

<p>That the Austrians were determined to
defend the town at all hazards may be
judged from the fact that they had accumulated
there sufficient stores for a year.
The defending army formed a semicircle
facing north and east, with the fortress in
the centre. By pushing forward his right
wing towards the west, General Russki
formed another outer semicircle. Then the
Russian semicircle began to contract, and
with vice-like pressure forced the Austrian
line back and back.</p>

<p>The battle lasted for seven days, and the
fighting was of the most stubborn nature.
By means of successive bombardments and
infantry attacks on the defending forces,
the Russians gradually forced themselves
forward. But every inch of ground was
contested, and the losses on both sides were
enormous. As the days passed, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the superiority of the Russian artillery
began to assert itself, and the Austrian fire
weakened. At all points the Russians were
increasingly successful. At length on the
seventh day the main Austrian force, comprising
five army corps, was driven back
with heavy loss on to the town itself.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end. At
half-past two in the morning the actual
storming of the town began. The Austrians
attempted to reform their forces, but
were thrown into confusion by repeated
artillery and cavalry attacks. The Austrian
left was driven in. The whole army
was in danger of being surrounded.</p>

<p>At this stage of the conflict an episode
occurred which finally sealed the fate of the
Galician capital. A particularly searching
fire was directed by the Russian batteries
at the centre before the town, their object
being to impede the retreat of the Austrians,
who had been beaten on the right flank,
and, if possible, to surround the town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
completely before its garrisons could be
withdrawn.</p>

<p>In the hope of checking the Russian advance
till the town had been evacuated, the
Austrians threw out a rearguard screen of
Slav troops with a backing of Magyars,
who received orders to shoot the Slavs down
from behind the moment they showed any
hesitation. This circumstance became
known to the Russian commander, and at
the critical moment a terrific artillery fire
was opened over the heads of the Slavs upon
the retreating Austrian columns. This
dropping hail of projectiles set up a wild
panic in the ranks of the enemy. Abandoning
guns, ammunition, and stores, his troops
broke into frantic disorder, and fled helter-skelter
along the road to Grodek.</p>

<p>This was shortly after nine o’clock, and
proved to be the decisive stroke of the
battle. It appeared that the Austrians
then lost all hopes of holding the town, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the strong forts by which it was defended
rapidly fell one after another.</p>

<p>It was now that the strong Russian forces
poured into the town from the north, and
the final battle began in the streets. For
some time the fierce fight was kept up,
but the Austrian detachments, recognising
the hopelessness of their position, surrendered
one by one.</p>

<p>The Slav inhabitants received the conquerors
with demonstrations of delight and
shouts of “Long live the army of the
Russian liberators.” The singing of the
Russian National Anthem mingled with the
last shots fired at the routed Austrians in
the neighbourhood of the town.</p>

<p>Then the progress of the Russian regiments
through the town became like a
triumphal procession. As they passed down
the streets cheers were raised, and flowers
were showered upon them from the crowded
windows. At half-past ten the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
flag fluttered out from the staff on the roof
of the Town Hall.</p>

<p>Russia thus achieved the first great
triumph of the war and ensured the accomplishment
of the first step towards Berlin&mdash;the
smashing of the military power of Austria.
In addition they had won 637 guns,
44 quickfirers, flags, and 64,000 prisoners,
in addition to immense stores of ammunition
and provisions.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Significance of Lemberg</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Austrians had prepared Lemberg for
a siege of at least a year. The Russians
captured it in a week. The fortresses,
which were reckoned as first-class examples
of modern fortifications, were reduced to
ruins by the bombardment of the Russian
heavy artillery. The victory, therefore,
proved to the Russians, just as Liège and
Namur had proved to the Germans in the
west, that modern fortresses are helpless
against modern artillery. The Russians
employed no remarkably heavy guns, but
merely their ordinary siege howitzers.
There are no secrets about these weapons.
They are of about the same calibre and
weight as those of the Germans and of every
other army. The question of transport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
limits the size of these weapons, and no
nation can employ a gun which exceeds a
certain well-defined standard. Just as,
however, the fall of Namur and Liège was
responsible for rumours of secret monsters
from Krupp’s of infinite power, so the fall
of Lemberg was responsible for similar
rumours about the Russian guns. In each
case the rumours were absurd, for the
simple reason that guns of such immense
power would be too heavy to move.</p>

<p>In any case, the Russians had every
reason to be satisfied with the performance
of their guns. They had proved themselves
capable of reducing the finest modern fortifications.
What had been accomplished at
Lemberg could be done with equal facility at
Przemysl, Cracow, Posen and all the other
fortresses guarding the road to Berlin.
Germany and Austria have spent millions
on these fortresses, which have been proved
to be practically worthless as obstacles in
the path of an invader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
The remarkable speed with which the
position had been taken, coupled with the
enormous losses inflicted on the defending
army, was certain to have a most damaging
effect on the <i>moral</i> of the Austrians.
Owing to racial jealousies and hatreds the
Austrians had already displayed a lack of
cohesion and fighting spirit, except perhaps
in the German and Magyar regiments
operating with the chief army in Poland.
Now the last shreds of moral force would
disappear. The troops had been sullen and
half-hearted; now they were dejected as
well. To extricate herself from a very
critical position Austria demanded the
utmost spirit and determination from her
troops. In her hour of need there was
every prospect of their failing her.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the defeat, coupled
with the rout of the army in Poland,
made it impossible for Austria to make any
further offensive movement in Russia, or
defensive movement in Galicia for some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
considerable time. Her armies were scattered
in confusion and fleeing at random.
To arrest the flight of a routed army, to
disentangle the units and to present a
battle front again is the most difficult task
a commander can have. And in the present
case the difficulties of the Austrian generals
were increased a hundredfold by the fact
that their men were not only defeated
but broken in spirit. Further resistance
east of Przemysl was out of the question.
The Russians were undisputed masters of
Eastern Galicia.</p>

<p>The Russians, therefore, gained an immense
moral advantage over the troops
facing them. The material gains were on
a similar gigantic scale.</p>

<p>Lemberg had been expected by the
Austrians to hold out indefinitely. It contained
a year’s supply of provisions and
munitions. These vast quantities of stores
fell into the hands of the Russians, thus
lightening very considerably the strain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
upon the transport and commissariat departments.
Lemberg, moreover, being the
capital of Galicia and the chief Austrian
military centre north of the Carpathians,
contained an arsenal, railway works, and
numerous other works useful to the invaders.
The huge capture of rolling stock was
perhaps the most valuable of all. When
it was seen that it was doubtful whether
the town would be able to hold out long,
the Austrians had collected all the available
rolling stock, in order to remove as much
as possible of the stores west to Przemysl
and Cracow. The rapid success of the
Russians prevented the carrying out of
this plan. The Austrians made desperate
efforts, but the lines became hopelessly congested,
and not a train escaped. Thirty
locomotives and immense numbers of carriages
and trucks thus fell into the hands of
the Russians.</p>

<p>Most important of all were the strategic
results. Lemberg, being the chief town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
in Galicia, and the administrative centre,
the town is naturally the point on which
all the means of communication converge.
Eight railways and as many high roads
connect the town with every point of civil
and military importance north of the Carpathians.
It is, therefore, an ideal base
for the Russian operation in Galicia. It
commands the approaches to Przemysl on
the west and to the passes over the Carpathians
leading to Vienna and Buda-Pesth on
the south. It has railway connection with
no less than four points on the Russian
frontier, allowing direct communication
with the important military centres of Kiev
on the east and Warsaw on the north.</p>

<p>Lemberg may therefore be described as
the key to Austria. Its possession opened
the way for the Russian armies westwards
to Silesia and Berlin, southwards to Buda-Pesth
and Vienna. It was the most important
town in the whole eastern theatre
of war, and its capture was far more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
a stage in an advance, it was an event
which must have the most far-reaching
effects on the whole course of the war.</p>

<p>In addition to these direct advantages
gained by Russia, the victory had other
results affecting the course of the war. It
roused the entire Slav race, giving increased
enthusiasm and determination to those
engaged in the war and strengthening
the sympathies of those who had remained
neutral. Bulgaria and Roumania, neither
of whom were on friendly terms with the
Serbs as a result of the recent wars in the
Balkans, now veered round at the prospect
of the power of the Austrians being broken.
More important was the effect produced on
Turkey. Bound to Germany in many
ways, Turkey had been seriously considering
whether she should not throw in her lot
with the Kaiser in the hope of regaining
some of the territory of which she had
been despoiled after the Balkan war. German
diplomacy had been making strenuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
efforts to induce the Turkish Government
to tempt fate once more. And relations
between Russia and Turkey had been rather
strained over the <i>Goeben</i> incident. The
purchase of Germany’s finest Dreadnought,
by Turkey, was of vital interest to Russia,
who could not afford to allow Turkey to
become the chief naval power in the south-east
of Europe. In answer to her representations,
Turkey had protested her determination
to remain neutral, but there was
considerable cause for doubting the sincerity
of these protestations. The fact
that there were numerous German officers
with the Turkish army and superintending
the placing of the heavy Krupp guns in
position along the fortification of the Dardanelles
did not tend to allay the suspicions.
After Lemberg, however, Turkey realised
that Austria was a broken power, that
Germany was in a position of some jeopardy
and that neither was a suitable ally for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
a nation whose chief object was to rob
its neighbours.</p>

<p>Although, however, the capture of Lemberg
was a triumph of the first magnitude
which rendered the downfall of Austria
inevitable, it must not be assumed that
Russia’s task was to all intents and purposes
accomplished. It was rashly predicted at
the time, as in the case of every Russian
victory, that the end of the war was in
sight, that there was nothing to prevent
the steam roller going full speed ahead to
Berlin. Subsequent events have proved
how ill-founded were these prophecies, most
of which were based more on hope than on
fact. Lemberg fell during the first week
of September, and Russia is still a very long
way from Berlin.</p>

<p>One triumph does not smash a nation,
not even a ramshackle one such as Austria.
After Lemberg she was in a desperate
position, faced with almost certain defeat,
but she still had considerable fighting power.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
France struggled for over a year after Sedan.
And Lemberg was not such an overwhelmingly
decisive event as Sedan. The latter
resulted in the surrender in an Emperor,
his finest generals, and his chief army. Lemberg,
after all, only routed the chief Austrian
army. In spite of terrific losses, and in spite
of the demoralisation of her troops, Austria
still had over two million men in the field
and a large number of reserves, as yet
untouched. Obviously she was still a
power that could not be neglected.</p>

<p>Large numbers of Austrians were still
in south-west Poland. The fortresses of
Cracow and Przemysl were untaken, and
were defended by practically the whole remaining
military force of the country.
And reinforcements were being hurried up
to help stay the Russian advance. The
operations against Serbia and Montenegro
had been finally abandoned, further reserves
were being called to the colours, and
the armies thus raised were being hurried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
northward. German aid was also forthcoming.
The success of the operations in
Prussia had set free some of the army corps
for the purpose for which they were originally
intended.</p>

<p>Germany was also forced to realise that
the Russian advance was a serious menace,
and it was now that she transferred troops
from the west to the east. This eased
the task of the Allies, but, of course,
made that of the Russians all the more
difficult. The German advance into
Western Poland, which has now continued
for nearly two months, is as determined
as that into France. Unless, therefore,
the Russians can win a stupendous victory,
this second phase of the war will be prolonged.
There can, however, be no doubt
as to the final result. Russia is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, the capture of Lemberg
was one of the most significant events of
the whole war. The tide of victory had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
now definitely turned in favour of Russia,
nothing short of a miracle could stem it.
But Russia was still faced with a task of
considerable magnitude, and much time
and patient work was necessary before it
could be finally accomplished.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>To the unthinking, Russia has proved
somewhat disappointing. Such great things
were expected of her by those who knew
nothing of the conditions in the eastern
theatre of war. At the end of over a month
of fighting she had not advanced a mile
along the direct road to Berlin. Her army
in the north, after an advance which was
acclaimed as of tremendous importance,
was defeated, driven back and practically
forgotten. The south-west of Poland was
still overrun by the enemy, and the only real
advance that had been made was to penetrate
about a hundred miles into Galicia.</p>

<p>Certainly it does not appear at first glance
to be a very considerable achievement. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
is only when matters are thoroughly investigated
that the truth is grasped. Russia
has achieved more than any other Power
engaged in the war, and far more than could
rightly have been expected of her. In the
west the Germans advanced to the very
gates of Paris, but they won no decisive
victory; the allied armies remained intact
and unbroken. The Allies then assumed
the offensive, and the Germans were pushed
back. But again no decisive battle has
been fought, at least during the period
under review. The German armies are, at
the moment of writing, still intact and to
all appearances capable of assuming a
renewed offensive with vigour. It is only
in the eastern theatre of war that victories
have been won. Tarnopol, Tomasov, and
Lemberg were not merely favourable engagements
which resulted in the enemy
being forced to retreat a few miles. They
were victories which routed as well as
defeated the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
It must be remembered, too, that these
operations in Galicia and Poland are being
fought on the same vast scale as those in
the west. They extend along a front of
no less than 200 miles. In point of numbers
engaged, the Galician and Polish operations
are again very similar to those in France.
In fact, the conditions in the east and west
are more or less equal, and therefore Russia’s
victories were the only really decisive engagements
won by any of the armies.</p>

<p>Official opinion in Russia would have
been quite satisfied if, by the beginning of
September, the mobilisation was completed,
and Warsaw, Vilna and Kiev still in
Russian hands. It was certainly expected
that at the end of a month’s warfare
Russia would be engaged in fiercely defending
her own territories and in making
desperate efforts to drive the invaders back
over the frontier. In short, she was fully
expected to be faced with a month or more
of sheer defensive fighting before she could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
hope to advance. The magnitude of her
task in this direction will be obvious when
it is remembered that, in addition to the
inevitable slowness of mobilisation which
renders her a comparatively easy prey for
invaders, she has a frontier of well over
1,000 miles to defend against Germany and
Austria.</p>

<p>Of course, much was made of the fact
that Russia could mobilise no less than
eight million men. It was assumed that
an immense army of at least two million
men would march on Berlin. By sheer
force of numbers Russia was going to bring
both Austria and Germany to their knees.
In the first place there is a limit to human
organising power, and it is doubtful whether
any general can successfully direct the
operations of such vast quantities of men.
Napoleon himself never fought with a
million men, and no modern general has
yet proved that he possesses the military
genius of the Corsican. Numbers are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
very well up to a certain point, but in
excess they are only a hindrance and a
menace. The larger the army the slower
it moves. It is the very unwieldiness of
the armies in the west that has caused their
lack of success. They have such enormous
fighting power that there is no particular
reason why either should suffer defeat.</p>

<p>Superfluous men do not add to an army’s
efficiency. They only hamper its mobility
and throw an extra strain on the commissariat
and transport. The ideal army
is the one which is large enough to accomplish
its object thoroughly and no more.
Employing two men to do the work of one
is merely a wasteful proceeding.</p>

<p>Russia has no intention of putting all
her eight million men in the firing line.
Her object is to place adequate armies in the
field and to maintain those armies at their
full strength of first-class fighting men.
She has no particular ambition to make
herself bankrupt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
In view of the difficulties with which she
had to contend and the gigantic nature of
her task, Russia may be said to have
accomplished a brilliant feat in rendering
the ultimate defeat of Austria inevitable
and in opening up the most advantageous
road to Berlin. The remarkable success of
her mobilisation has been followed by
equally brilliant achievements in the field.
Soukhomlinov’s work has not been in vain.
Russia has indeed fulfilled her part and
made the issue of the war as sure as it is
humanly possible to make it. Much remains
to be done, but the tasks of smashing
Austria and reducing Germany to her knees
will now be taken up with every confidence.</p>

<p>The events in Russia have been as significant
as those in the battlefields. Not only
has this war proved that Russia as a military
power has come into its own at last, but it
marks the beginning of a new era in Russian
history. The world is witnessing the rebirth
of Russia. The nation is united<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
as it has never previously been. The
old autocratic institutions are passing away,
the Duma is gaining strength, the coming
rehabilitation of Poland is a master-stroke
of liberalism. A new Russia is emerging.
Democracy is coming into its own at last
in the empire of the Tzar.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
